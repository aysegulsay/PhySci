1	1992	Evanescent black holes	Curtis G. Callan, Jr. Steven B. Giddingst Jeffrey A. Harvey Andrew Strominger	Evanescent black holes A renormalizable theory of quantum gravity coupled to a dilaton and conformal matter in two spacetime dimensions is analyzed. The theory is shown to be exactly solvable classically. Included among the exact classical solutions are configurations describing the formation of a black hole by collapsing matter. The problem of Hawking radiation and back reaction of the metric is analyzed to leading order in a I/N expansion, where N is the number of matter fields. The results suggest that the collapsing matter radiates away all of its energy before an event horizon has a chance to form, and black holes thereby disappear from the quantum-mechanical spectrum. It is argued that the matter asymptotically approaches a zero-energy "bound state" which can carry global quantum numbers and that a unitary S matrix including such states should exist. Following his ground-breaking work [I] on black-hole evaporation, Hawking [2] argued that the process of formation and subsequent evaporation of a black hole is not governed by the usual laws of quantum mechanics: Rather, pure states evolve into mixed states [3]. This conjecture is hard to check in detail because of the many degrees of freedom and inherent complexity of the process in four spacetime dimensions. It would be useful to have a toy model in which greater analytic control is possible. In this paper we investigate such a model. It is a consistent, renormalizable theory of quantum gravity in two spacetime dimensions coupled to conformal matter. It contains black-hole solutions as well as Hawking radiation, and is exactly soluble at the classical level. As we shall see, the theory is just complicated enough to enable one to ask the interesting questions concerning black-hole evaporation, yet simple enough to obtain some answers. We begin with the action in two spacetime dimensions: where g, III, and f are the metric, dilaton, and matter fields, respectively, and X, is a cosmological constant. This action arises as the effective action describing the radial modes of extremal dilatonic black holes in four or higher dimensions [4-6]; it is also closely related to the spacetime action for c l noncritical strings. Ho~ever, these connections need not concern us here; the theory defined by the action (l) is of interest in its own right as a renormalizable theory of two-dimensional (2D) "dilaton gravity" coupled to matter. The quantization of related theories of 2D gravity has been considered in [7]. Gravitational collapse in related theories has been studied in [8]. The black-hole solution of (1) in the absence of matter has appeared previously [9] as a low-energy approximation to an exact solution of string theory. The classical theory described by (l) is most easily analyzed in the conformal gauge:  The dilaton and matter equations are The general solution of the dilaton, matter, and T+- equations (which do not involve f) may be expressed in terms of two free fields  The remaining constraint equations T++ =T——=0 may then be solved for u in terms off~ and w ~. The general solution is where M is an integration constant. We now consider solutions with f=0, which implies that one can set u =M/X. The conformal gauge leaves the conformal subgroup of diffeomorphisms unfixed. This gauge freedom can be fixed (on shell) by setting w=0. The general f=0 solution is then  up to constant translations of x. It is readily seen [6] that for M ~0 this corresponds to the r —t plane of the higherdimensional black holes of [4,5] near the extremal limit, or to the two-dimensional black-hole solution of [91, with M the black-hole mass. It is not immediately apparent that the parameter M corresponds to the. black-hole mass. This can be verified by a calculation of the ArnowittDeser-Misner (ADM) mass for this configuration as described in [9] or by a calculation of the Bondi mass as is done later in this paper. For M=O one can introduce coordinates in which the metric is fat and the dilaton field tt is linear in the spatial coordinate. This "linear dilaton" vacuum has appeared in previous studies of lowerdimensional string theories and also corresponds to extremal higher-dimensional black holes. From the above we may expect that any matter perturbation of the linear dilaton vacuum will result in the formation of a black hole. To see that this is indeed the case consider the example of an f shock wave traveling in the x direction with magnitude a described by the stress tensor  For x+ (xo+, this is simply the linear dilaton vacuum, while for x+ & xo+ it is identical to a black hole of mass axp+X after shifting x by a/X . The two solutions are joined along the f wave. The Penrose diagram for this spacetime is depicted in Fig. 1. The fact that any f wave, no matter how weak, produces a black hole, of course, implies that weak-field perturbation theory breaks down. The reason for this is simple. From (I) it is evident that the weak-field expansion parameter is proportional to e~. Equation (13) shows that this parameter becomes arbitrarily large close to SL—or to the singularity and that the weak-field expansion diverges in this region. This has a higher-dimensional interpretation as follows [5]. When (I) is taken as an effective-field theory for higher-dimensional dilatonic black holes, the 2D linear dilaton vacuum corresponds to the infinite throat in the extremal black-hole solutions. The center of the black hole is at x+x =0. An arbitrarily small infalling matter wave then produces a nonextremal black hole with an event horizon and a singularity. So far the discussion has been purely classical. As a first step towards including quantum effects, we now compute the Hawking radiation in the fixed background geometry (11). This can be computed exactly for the collapsing f wave because of the elegant relation [10] between Ha~king radiation and the trace anomaly for 20 conformal matter coupled to gravity. The calculation and its physical interpretation is clearest in coordinates ~here the metric is asymptotically constant on JR—.%e thus set with A.xp+ =exp(X, crp+). By the standard one-loop anomaly argument, the trace TI+ of the stress tensor is proportional to the curvature scalar which is, in these coordinates, just the Laplacian of p. The result is The functions of integration t ~ must be fixed by boundary conditions. For the collapsing f wave, T should vanish identically in the linear dilaton region, and there should be no incoming radiation along Sg except for the classical f wave at op+. Using the formula for p, this implies The stress tensor is now completely determined, and one The limiting value of T is the flu—x off-particle energy across Str. In the far past of Sir (o —~) this «» vanishes exponentially while, as the horizon is approached, it approaches the constant value A. /48. This is nothing but Hawking radiation. The surprising result that the Hawking radiation rate is asymptotically independent of mass has been found in other studies of two-dimensional gravity. The total energy lost by the collapsing f wave at some value of retarded time cr can be estimated by integrating the outgoing flux along Stt up to cr . If the total radiated flux is computed by integrating along all of Sti, an infinite answer is obtained, because the outgoing flux approaches a steady state at late retarded times. This is obviously nonsense —the black hole cannot lose more mass than it possesses. This nonsensical answer is, of course, a result of the fact that we have neglected the back reaction of the radiation on the collapsing f wave. As a first step toward analyzing the back reaction, it is useful to estimate, to leading order in the mass, the retarded time at which the integrated energy of the Hawking radiation on Sit equals the initial mass axp+A, of the incoming f wave. This is given by  Unfortunately this picture cannot yet be taken seriously because the turn-around point at which all the energy has backscattered has coordinates (crp+, crp++(In24)/k). The value independent of ao+ or a. As we have stated, e~ is the loop expansion parameter for dilaton gravity. Since this parameter is not small at the turn-around point, our oneloop calculation of the Hawking flux breaks down before the f wave fully backscatters. The situation can be remedied by proliferating the number of matter fields. This introduces a new small expansion parameter into the theory: 1/N, where N is the (large) number of matter fields [11]. For N matter fields the Hawking flux is N times as great and one finds that the f wave has completely backscattered by (crp+, op+ +(In24/N)/A, ). For large N, the value of the dilaton at this point is which indeed corresponds to weak coupling. This suggests that, for large N, the essential physics of Hawking radiation back reaction takes place in a weak-coupling regime and should be amenable to a semiclassical treatment. In what follows, we will present some proposals for the development of such a fully consistent treatment of the scattering problem, along with some informed conjectures about the form of the solution. In a systematic expansion in 1/N, one must include the one-loop matter-induced contribution to the gravitational effective action at the same order as the classical action (1). This incorporates both Hawking radiation and back reaction. Because of the way the dilaton varies with position, there is a region in spacetime where the O(N) oneloop matter-induced gravitational action is of the same order as the strictly classical part and the loop coupling constant is nonetheless small. As described above, it is precisely in this region where the essential back-reaction physics will occur and a semiclassical treatment of the proper action should give meaningful answers. To leading order in 1/N, and in the conformal gauge, the quantum effective action to be solved is  The last term is the Liouville term induced by the N matter fields and the conformal gauge constraints [the T~ ~ equations of (3)] are modified by its presence in a way which will shortly be made explicit. We have also tuned the coe%cient of the possible Liouville cosmological constant (to be distinguished from the classical "dilatonic" cosmological constant A.) to zero. In a slight abuse of terminology, we nevertheless refer to the dynamics governed by the last term in (23) as Liouville gravity. Solving the quantum theory to leading order in 1/N is equivalent to solving the classical theory described by S~. Unlike So, it does not appear possible to solve SN exactly, though it may be possible to solve the equations numerically. At present the best we can do is make the following educated guess about the evolution of an incoming f wave. Consider a quantization of the system defined on null surfaces Z(cr ) of constant o . The light-cone Hamiltonian P —evolves the system in the direction of increasing o . The changes P+ are not separately conserved because translation invariance is spontaneously broken. The combination H =P++P —generates an unbroken symmetry and is conserved for spacelike surfaces. In fact, there are in general two conserved quantities, given by boundary terms at the two spatial infinities. For the null surfaces Z, the ei envalue M(o ) of H is given by a boundary term on Sn (assuming the boundary term on Jl vanishes) and is called the Bondi mass. The Bondi mass is not conserved because radiation energy can leak out onto J"R. Now consider an initial state at rr = —~ describing an incoming f~ wave as in (12), with the other N —1 f 's set to zero. In addition, it is useful to let this wave be characterized by the nonanomalous, left-moving global conserved charge Q~i, =fdo+8+f~. Near o e ~ is very large and the extra Liouville term may therefore be neglected in the description of the incoming state on Z( —~), which is essentially described by (13). As o increases away from S~, M(o ) will decrease. From the point of view of the quantum eA'ective action Sz, this is not due to Hawking radiation, but is simply a consequence of the extra Liouville term. As cr +~, it is plausible that M(o ) decreases to zero. However, the state on Z(o ) cannot revert to the linear dilaton vacuum on y I+ because it carries the conserved charge Q ~L.  The extra function t+ appearing in T++ is in agreement with (17) and is a consequence of the anomalous transformation law for T++. t+ is coordinate dependent and must be fixed by boundary conditions, as in (18). The linear dilaton configuration remains as the vacuum solution of the full leading N theory: The Bondi energy may then be defined for configurations which approach (25) on ZR (i.e., the configuration must not only be asymptotically flat, but presented in an asymptotically Minkowskian coordinate system). It is given by the surface term which must be added to the integral of The picture can thus be summarized as follows. A state with a nonzero charge Q ~1 and Bondi energy is incoming from Sp. As it evolves it loses its energy, but retains its charge. Asymptotically it approaches a zero-energy state with charge Q~I. on SL . This is illustrated in Fig. 2. This picture can be corroborated by direct analysis of the Bondi energy associated with data on a null surface Z corresponding to a charged f wave Such dat.a must satisfy the null constraint equations where Bp and bp are the asymptotically vanishing deviations of p and p from (25), and the right-hand side is to be evaluated on 1g. The first "dilaton" term was obtained in Ref. [9]. The term proportional to N, arising from matter quantum eAects, actually vanishes due to the boundary conditions (25). A modified formula is required in coordinate systems [such as in (11)]for which the fields do not asymptotically approach (25). Let us first consider the energy, evaluated on a surface Z, of a small amplitude f ~ wave packet localized in the dilaton region where e ~ is very large, i.e., at very large cr+ —cr . Then the Liouville terms proportional to N may be neglected in solving the constraints. M will be given as before by the integrated value of & B+fi B+fi times the x+ coordinate of the center of the wave packet. Now, however, consider the case where the fi wave packet is localized on Z in the "Liouville region" where e ~ is very small. The dilaton gravity term is then very small, and the action governing p and freduces to Liouville gravity coupled to conformal matter:  Since there is no invariant one can associate with a flat metric one would expect this expression to vanish. The fact that it does can be seen from direct evaluation of (29): If p approaches zero on Str as required by the boundary conditions (25), the derivatives of p and, consequently, M must also vanish. Thus all asymptotically flat states of Liouville gravity plus matter have zero energy. We now have a plausible global picture of the scattering process. The linear dilaton vacuum is divided into two regions characterized by e ~ large or small compared to N/12. This dividing line is timelike. For e ~))N/12, the dynamics are essentially that of classical dilaton gravity coupled to matter. For e ~(&N/[2, one has Liouville gravity coupled to matter. An incoming fi wave packet on SR begins in the dilaton gravity region where it has nonzero Bondi energy. However, it eventually crosses into the Liouville region, where all excitations have zero energy. By energy conservation, all of the initial energy of the wave packet must have radiated away to SR. There is no indication of an event horizon or singularity: In the re gion where the singularity occurs in the classical solution, the quantum dynamics are governed by Liouville gravity (with no cosmological constant) in which the curvature is required to vanish. One expects, therefore, a unitary S matrix evolving from 2 to 2+. One would hope to extract information about this 5 matrix from a semiclassical treatment of the large-N action (23). While we find this picture compelling, we emphasize that at present it must be regarded as speculative. We have not shown that an incoming f wave does not, in fact, produce a singularity, or even that the large-N equations of motion give a well-defined evolution. One might try to substantiate our speculations by doing weak-field perturbation theory in the amplitude of the f wave. However, preliminary calculations indicate that weak-field perturbation theory breaks down near the boundary of the dilaton and Liouville regions: The second-order perturbation is divergent. Thus in order to settle the question a nonperturbative analysis of the large-N theory (23) is probably needed. In conclusion, we have analyzed the process of blackhole formation and evaporation, including back reaction, in the I/N expansion of a two-dimensional model. A set of equations describing the process were found, but have not been solved so far. A qualitative analysis suggests that in this model would-be black holes in fact evaporate before an event horizon or singularity has a chance to form. Thus there is no indication that pure states evolve into mixed states. The implications of our result	
2	1971	Gravitational Radiation from Colliding Black Holes	S. W. Hawking 	Gravitational Radiation from Colliding Black Holes It is shown that there is an upper bound to the energy of the gravitational radiation emitted when one collapsed object captures another. In the case of two objects with equal masses m and zero intrinsic angular momenta, this upper bound is (2-W2) m. Weber' ' has recently reported coinciding measurements of short bursts of gravitational radiation at a frequency of 1660 Hz. These occur at a rate of about one per day and the bursts appear to be coming from the center of the galaxy. It seems likely'4 that the probability of a burst causing a coincidence between %eber's detectors is less than, . If one allows for this and assumes that the radiation is broadband, one finds that the energy flux in gravitational radiation must be at least 10'c erg/cm' day. 4 This would imply a mass loss from the center of the galaxy of about 20 000M o/yr. It is therefore possible that the mass of the galaxy might have been considerably higher in the past than it is now. ' This makes it important to estimate the efficiency with which rest-mass energy can be converted into gravitational radiation. Clearly nuclear reactions are insufficient since they release only about 1% of the rest mass. The efficiency might be higher in either the nonspherical gravitational collapse of a star or the collision and coalescence of two collapsed objects. Up to now no limits on the efficiency of the processes have been known. The object of this Letter is to show that there is a limit for the second process. For the case of two colliding collapsed objects, each of mass m and zero angular momentum, the amount of energy that can be carried away by gravitational or any other form of radiation is less than (2-v 2)m. I assume the validity of the Carter-Israel conjucture'' that the metric outside a collapsed object settles down to that of one of the Kerr family of solutions' with positive mass m and angular momentum a per unit mass less than or equal to m. (I am using units in which G=c =1.) Each of these solutions contains a nonsingular event horizon, two-dimensional sections of which are topographically spheres with area' The event horizon is the boundary of the region of space-time from which particles or photons can escape to infinity. I shall consider only space-times which are asymptotically flat in the sense of being weakly asymptotically simple. ' The metric on such a space M can be extended eonformally to a manifold with boundary iB which consists of M and two null hypersurfaces &' and 8 . These represent future and past null infinity, respectively. The event horizon can then be defined as J (8"), where a dot indicates the boundary, and for any set I, J (3) is the causal past of 8, i.e., the set of all points that can be reached from 3 by past-directed nonspacelike curves. The situation that I consider is one in which there are initially two collapsed objects or "black holes" a considerable distance apart in asymptotically flat space. The black holes are assumed to have formed at some earlier time as a result of either gravitational collapses or the amalgamation of smaller black holes. This situation can be described in terms of a spacelike hypersurface Z,. which is a Cauchy surface for the asymptotically flat region of space-time. On Z,. there will be two separate regions, B, and B» which contain closed, trapped surfaces. " In fact the surface Z,. need not exist within the regions B, and B, since what happens there cannot affect what happens outside. Just outside B, and B, will be two two-spheres which are the intersection of J (8') with Z, By the Carter-Israel conjecture the areas of these two spheres will be to a good approximation given by formula (1) for the values m„a, and m„a, of the masses and specific angular momenta of the two black holes. Suppose now that the two black holes capture each other to form a single black hole which settles down to a Kerr solution with parameters m, and a,. There will then be a later spacelike hypersur- By the conservation law for asymptotically flat space, '4'" the energy emitted in gravitational or other forms of radiation is m, +m, -m, . The efficiency e = (m, +m, ) '(m, +m, -ms) is limited by Eq. (2). The highest limit on e is 2 which occurs if m, =me =a, =a„a,~0. If a, =a, =0, then e & (1 -2 '"). It should be stressed that these are upper limits. The actual efficiency might be much less. Imagine a situation in which there were initially a large number of black holes. First these could combine in pairs, and then the resulting holes could combine, and so on. On dimensional grounds one could expect the efficiency to be the same at each stage. Thus one would extract a face Z& on which there will be a single region B3 containing closed trapped surfaces. Just outside B, will be a two-sphere Z~A J (0") whose area is given by formula (1) with m, and a,. Now J (8') is generated by null geodesic segments which may have past end points but mhich can have no future end points. ' '" I shall take it that there are no singularities in the exterior region J (8')A J'(Z,.). Whether such "naked" singularities can occur or whether the singularities are always hidden behind the event horizon is an unresolved question. " One would not expect to obtain a limit on the energy that could be carried to infinity by gravitational radiation if there were a naked singularity since what happens at a singularity is not governed by any known laws. I shall therefore consider only those situations where what happens in J (d')CLJ'(Z, . ) is determined by data on Z,, i.e., where Z,. is a Cauchy surface for Z (&')AJ'(Z, ). One can choose Zz so that it is a Cauchy surface for Z (s')A J'(Zz) and show that every null geodesic generating segment of J' (5') in J'(Z,.)A J' (Z&) must intersect Zz. By the Carter-Israel conjecture the solution in 7 (8')AJ'(Z~) resembles the exterior Kerr solution and so contains no singularities. Thus each null geodesic generating segment of J (8') in 4'(Z~) will be geodesically complete in the future direction. I assume also that the weak energy condition holds": T„K'K'~ 0 for every null vector K'. It then follows that the convergence p of the null geodesic generators of J (d') cannot be positive anywhere since if it were there would be a caustic and hence a future end point of some of the generators. " This shows that the area of Z~A J (&') must be greater than or equal to the area of Z, A.J (S') (in fact, it must be strictly greater). Therefore, very large fraction of the original mass (this argument was suggested by C. W. Misner). At each stage the emitted bursts would be longer and stronger. This might explain %cher's observations. One can also apply this result that the area on the event horizon increases to the case of a single black hole on which various particles and fields impinge. One then has that the final mass m~ and specific angular momentum a, must satisfy the inequality  ular, if a, is equal to zero, then 2m, '&m, [m, +(m,'-a,')'"]. Using an idea of Penrose, " Christodolou' has shown that one can get arbitrarily near this limit. One can interpret this as extracting the rotational energy of the black hole.	
3	1995	N=2 extremal black holes		N=2 extremal black holes It is shown that extremal magnetic black hole solutions of %=2 supergravity coupled to vector multiplets X with a generic holomorphic prepotential F(X ) can be described as supersymmetric solitons which interpolate between maximally symmetric limiting solutions at spatial infinity and the horizon. A simple exact solution is found for the special case that the ratios of the X are real, and it is seen that the logarithm of the conformal factor of the spatial metric equals the Kahler potential on the vector multiplet moduli space. Several examples are discussed in detail. I. INTRODUCTION Black holes seem to be a never-ending source of surprises. While much has been learned about their behavior, much remains to be understood, even at the classical level. In this paper we study the classical supersymmetric solutions in a general theory with N=2 supersymmetry. Previous work on this subject can be found in [1,2]. The solutions appear to have a richer structure than the more thoroughly studied N=4 case. In Sec. II we recall some aspects of N=2 supergravity. In Sec. III the magnetic solutions are described in terms of trajectories in the special geometry of the N=2 moduli space which terminate at a supersymmetric fixed point at the horizon. In Sec. IV we find that the equations can be integrated for a restricted but large class of cases. An intriguing relation between the Kahler potential on the moduli space and the metric conformal factor emerges. Some simple examples are worked out in detail in Sec. V. We do not attain a complete characterization of the classical geometry of N =2 black holes in this paper, but we hope that our results prove useful for future efforts in this direction. II. SPECIAL GEOMETRY AND %=2 SUPERSYMMETRY We study N=2 supergravity coupled to n N=2 vector multiplets in the framework of special geometry [3—6]. In this section some formulas that will be needed in the following are recalled. Further details can be found in [4] whose notation we adopt. The supergravity theory is defined in terms of a projective holomorphic section (X (P'), —i/2F~($')), A=0, 1, . . . ,n, i =1,. . . ,n, of an Sp(2n+2) vector bundle over the moduli space parametrized by @'. (We note that alternate conventions are often employed in which the definition of F& differs by a factor of 2i.) In some cases the theory can be described in terms of a holomorphic function F(X) of degree two:  Given a prepotential F(X), or a holomorphic section (X,—i/2Ft, ), one can construct the entire scalar and vector parts of the action. It is convenient to introduce the inhomogeneous coordinates We assume Z (tb;) to be invertible, so that, in special coordinates, 8Z /oIQ'= 8, . In this case the complex scalars Z'= @' (i = 1,. . . ,n) represent the lowest component of the n vector multiplets of N=2 supersymmetry. The Kahler potential determining the metric of these fields is where %&~=1/4(Ft~+FA~) and f(Z)=(X ) F(X). In the conformal gauge [4], The graviphoton field strength, as well as the field strengths of the n Abelian vector multiplets, are constructed out of n+ 1 field strengths F,=8 W —B,W . The graviphoton field strength is where the superscript + (—) denotes the (anti-)self-dual part. This defines the central charge of the theory, since it enters into gravitino transformation rules. The vector field strengths which enter the gaugino supersymmetry transformations are The anti-self-dual vector field strengths F are part of the symplectic vector where again the expression for the matrix ~~x is derived from the prepotential F(X) [4—6]. The vector part of the action is then proportional to  and the graviphoton field strength can be written in the manifestly symplectic form  The Lagrangian for the scalar components of the vector multiplets is defined by the Kahler potential as where g" is the space-time metric, and The gravitino supersymmetry transformation law, to leading order in Fermi fields, is  where n, P = 1,2 are SU(2) indices and A ~ =i/ 2NAx[X~B~XX (8 X )XX]. T—he gaugino transformation law is Bogomolny-Prasad-Sommerfield (BPS) states of the %=2 theory have a mass equal to the central charge z. It follows from the supersymmetry transformation rules that this is simply the graviphoton charge [6] where q('& and q( ) are electric and magnetic charges associated to i S' and F and comprise a symplectic vector. Dual ity transformations of the X=2 theory correspond to different choices of the symplectic representative (X,—i/2F A) of the symplectic geometry. III. MAGNETIC N=2 BPS BLACK HOLES In this section we discuss the general form of the supersymmetric magnetic black hole solutions and their interpretation as interpolating solitons. It has been shown by Tod [2] in general that, for %=2 theories, a static metric admitting supersymmetries can be put in the form  For spherically symmetric black hole solutions U will be a function only of the radial coordinate r. By solving the Bianchi identities dF =0 we then find for the radial component of the magnetic field strengths F„—=2e„@F& Inserting (15) and (16) into the gravitino transformation law, and demanding that the variation vanish for some choice of e, we derive the following first order differential equation:  where U'—=8U/Bp, p=1/r, and we employ the notation (ZNq)= ZN~x q —. Equation (17) may be viewed as determining U as a function of the moduli fields Z . A vanishing gaugino transformation further requires that the moduli fields obey Differentiating again with respect to p and substituting (17) leads to the second order differential equation This equation is independent of U and can be viewed as a generalized geodesic equation which describes how Z evolves as one moves into the core of the black hole. Initial conditions for Z are specified at infinity (p=0) corresponding to the asymptotic values of the field. The first derivative of Z is then fixed in terms of the charge of the black hole by the supersymmetry constraint (18). Z will then evolve until it runs into a fixed point. It is evident from (18) and (19) that these fixed points are at where (Z ) ' = 0. Each fixed point is typically surrounded by a finite basin of attraction. The limiting form of the metric at such a fixed point is found by integrating (17), where the constant c is given by This corresponds to the maximally symmetric charged Robinson-Bertotti universe. Thus, as in [7], the extremal black holes may be viewed as solitons which interpolate between maximally symmetric vacua at infinity and the horizon. The locations of the fixed points (20) depend on the charges but not on the asymptotic values of the moduli fields. Thus if the asymptotic values of those fields are adiabatically changed, the geometry of the black hole near the horizon remains fixed. Symplectic invariance implies a similar structure for many of the dyonic and electrically charged extremal black holes. IV. SPACE-TIME GEOMETRY FROM KAHLER GEOMETRY -K(z,z) —2dABc ImZA ImzB I~c (3o) In this section we consider a remarkably simple special class of solutions which exist for a generic prepotential. We will work in a symplectic basis in which q =0 in order to simplify the equations. In such a basis the fixed points Zf,„d move to infinite coordinate values. Thus solutions for which the moduli field is constant at the fixed point (which corresponds to the Reissner-Nordstrom solution) cannot be described in this basis. In the q =0 basis it is straightforward to check that (17) and (18) are solved by provided that the asymptotic value of Z' is restricted to obey Alternatively we may have provided that the asymptotic value of Z' is restricted to obey The restrictions imply that these solutions exist only at special points in the moduli space where all Z' are either real or imaginary. More general solutions may be obtained from these by symplectic transformations. Thus the space-time metric is where each Z' solves a three-dimensional harmonic equation and is given in Eq. (24) or (26). Hence the logarithm of the spatial conformal factor is identified with the moduli space Kahler potential. V. EXAMPLES OF %~2 BPS STATES A. Calabi-Yau magnetic black holes The prepotential is We consider pure imaginary Z" and real d&Itc (corresponding to the classical Calabi-Yau moduli space), B. Massive and massless SU(1, n)/SU(n) supersymmetric white holes These configurations are nontrivial in the limit when the Arnowitt-Deser-Misner (ADM) mass tends to zero. It will be interesting to understand if or when such states can arise in a physical theory. The limit M—+0 can be achieved via Z ~0. In this limit the scalar field becomes inversely proportional to the radius r, For N= 4 BPS states the analogous massless states have been studied recently [8—10]. The configuration exhibits a repulsive (i.e., antigravitating) singularity and was referred to as a supersymmetric white hole [9]. The difference between the metric (37) for N = 2 and the corresponding metric obtained in [8,9] for N=4 is that g« =(g«)'/. This does not change the repulsive nature of the singularity. C. SO(2,1)/SO(2) x SO(2, n)/SO(2) x SO(n) BPS states Here again we consider pure imaginary Z: The metric of the BPS configuration defined by the Kahler potential is given by The configurations presented in this example may contain both types of supersymmetric states, those with attractive singularities and those with the repulsive ones, depending on the choice of the parameters describing the harmonic functions Note that this example actually provides one of the particular choices of Calabi-Yau magnetic black holes. D. N=4, 2 pure supergravity black holes from Kahler geometry perspective Here we will analyze some previously known supersymmetric black hole solutions in the framework of the manifestly symplectic formalism [6].The Kahler potential is different from the conformal gauge (4) and is given by 1. SL(2,Z) axion dila-ton dyons It is instructive to analyze the known SL(2g)-invariant axion-dilaton dyonic black hole solution [11]of N =4 supergravity as a particular solution of N =2 supergravity coupled to an N=2 vector multiplet. These solutions have complex moduli. The prepotential for this theory is F(X)=2XX'. The holomorphic section includes For the axion-dilaton black hole X and X can be identified with two complex harmonic functions ~&, ~2 as follows: The Kahler potential is in agreement with the metric of the axion-dilaton black hole found in [11] 2. Reissner-Nordstrom solution The prepotential for pure N =2 supergravity is F(X)=(X ) . The Kahler potential of this theory in the manifestly symplectic formalism [6] is given by where X = V '(x) is a real (imaginary) harmonic function for electric (magnetic) Reissner-Nordstrom extremal supersymmetric black hole [1,2]. In conclusion, we have found a simple relation between the special geometry describing the couplings of scalars and vectors in extended locally supersymmetric theories and the space-time geometry of the black-hole-type solutions in these theories. It is likely that more general solutions with complex moduli will be found in this framework.	It is shown that extremal magnetic black hole solutions of %=2 supergravity coupled to vector multiplets X with a generic holomorphic prepotential F(X ) can be described as supersymmetric solitons which interpolate between maximally symmetric limiting solutions at spatial infinity and the horizon. A simple exact solution is found for the special case that the ratios of the X are real, and it is seen that the logarithm of the conformal factor of the spatial metric equals the Kahler potential on the vector multiplet moduli space. Several examples are discussed in detail.
4	1971	Black Holes in General Relativity 	S.W. Hawking	Black Holes in General Relativity  Abstract. It is assumed that the singularities which occur in gravitational collapse are not visible from outside but are hidden behind an event horizon. This means that one can still predict the future outside the event horizon. A black hole on a spacelike surface is defined to be a connected component of the region of the surface bounded by the event horizon. As time increase, black holes may merge together but can never bifurcate. A black hole would be expected to settle down to a stationary state. It is shown that a stationary black hole must have topologically spherical boundary and must be axisymmetric if it is rotating. These results together with those of Israel and Carter go most of the way towards establishing the conjecture that any stationary black hole is a Kerr solution. Using this conjecture and the result that the surface area of black holes can never decrease, one can place certain limits on the amount of energy that can be extracted from black holes. 1. Introduction It has been known for some time that a non-rotating star of more than about two solar masses has no low temperature equilibrium configuration. This means that such a star must undergo catastrophic collapse when it has exhausted its nuclear fuel unless it has managed to eject sufficient matter to reduce its mass to less than twice that of the sun. If the collapse is exactly spherically symmetric, the metric is that of the Schwarzschild solution outside the star and has the following properties (see Fig. 1): 1. The surface of the star will pass inside the Schwarzschild radius r=2Gc-ZM. After this has happened there will be closed trapped surfaces [1, 2] around the star. A closed trapped surface is a spacelike 2-surface such that both the future directed families of null geodesics orthogonal to it are converging. In other words, it is in such a strong gravitational field that even the outgoing light from it is dragged inwards. 2. There is a space-time singularity. 3. The singularity is not visible to observers who remain outside the Schwarzschild radius. This means that the breakdown of our present physical theory which one expects to occur at a singularity cannot affect  what happens outside the Schwarzschild radius and one can still predict the future in the exterior region from Cauchy data on a spacelike surface. One can ask whether these three properties of spherical collapse are stable, i.e. whether they would still hold if the initial data for the collapse were perturbed slightly. This is vital because no real collapse situation will ever be exactly spherical. From the stability of the Cauchy problem in general relativity [3] one can show that a sufficiently small perturbation of the initial data on a spacelike surface will produce a perturbation of the solution which will remain small on a compact region in the Cauchy development of the surface. This shows that property (1) is stable, since there is a compact region in the Cauchy development of the initial surface which contains closed trapped surfaces. It then follows that property (2) is stable provided one makes certain reasonable assumptions such as that the energy density of matter is always positive. This is because the existence of a closed trapped surface implies the occurrence of a singularity under these conditions [4]. There remains the problem of the stability of property (3). Since the question of whether singularities are visible from outside depends on the solution at arbitrarily large times, one cannot appeal to the result on the stability of the Cauchy problem referred to above. Nevertheless it seems a reasonable conjecture that property (3) is indeed stable. If this is the case, we can still predict what happens outside collapsed objects, and we need not worry that something unexpected might occur every time a star in the galaxy collapsed. My belief in this conjecture is strengthened by the fact that Penrose [5] has tried and failed to obtain a contradiction to it, which would show that naked singularities must occur. Penrose's method has been generalised by Gibbons [6] who has shown that it cannot lead to a contradiction at least in some cases. This paper will be written therefore on the assumption that property (3) holds. In Section 2 a black hole is defined in terms of a event horizon and it is shown that the surface area of a black hole cannot decrease with time. In Section 3 it is shown that a rotating stationary black hole must be axisymmetric, and in Section 4 it is shown that any stationary black hole must have a topologically spherical boundary. Together with the results of Israel and Carter, this strongly supports the conjecture that a black hole settles down to a Kerr solution. This conjecture is used in Section 5 to relate the surface area of a black hole to its mass, angular momentum and electric charge. Using the result that the surface area cannot decrease with time one can then place upper bounds on the amounts of energy that can be extracted from black holes. These limits suggest that there may be a spin dependent force between two black holes analogous to that between magnetic dipoles.  2. The Event Horizon In order to discuss the region outside a collapsed object one needs a precise notion of infinity in an asymptotically flat space-time. This is provided by Penrose's concept of a weakly asymptotically simple space [2]; the spacetime manifold Jg of such a space can be imbedded in a larger manifold Je' on which there is a Lorentz metric g.b which is conformal to the spacetime metric gab, i.e. O,b = ~'~2gab where f2 is a smooth function which is zero and has non-vanishing gradient on the boundary ofJ¢/in Jff. This boundary consists of two null hypersurfaces J+ and Jwhich each have topology S 2 x R 1 and which represent future and past null infinity respectively. One can then interpret property (3) as saying that it should be possible to predict events near J+. I shall therefore say that a weakly asymptotically simple space is (future) asymptotically predictable if there is a partial Cauchy surface 0 ° such that 3"+ lies in the closure in Jff of D + (5~), the future Cauchy development of 5 e. (A partial Cauchy surface is a spacelike surface without edge which does not intersect any non-spacelike curve more than once. D+(5 a) is the set of all points p such that every past directed non-spacelike curve from p intersects 5 e if extended far enough.) Roughly speaking one would expect a space to be asymptotically predictable if there are no singularities in J+ (Se), the future of SP, which are naked, i.e. which lie in J-(J+), the past of future null infinity. One can make this more precise. Consider an asymptotically predictable space in which there are no singularities to the past of 5 a. Suppose there is a closed trapped surface 3- in D+(5~). Then there will be a singularity to the future of g-, i.e. there will be a nonspacelike geodesic in J+(J-) which is future incomplete. Can this geodesic be seen from 3"+? The answer is no. For suppose ~-- intersected J-(J+). Then there would be a point peJ+ in J+(J'). The past directed null geodesic generator of J+ through p would eventually leave J+(g') and so would contain a point q of the boundary J+(.Y--). Now the boundary of the future of any closed set ~ is generated by null geodesic segments which either have no past end-points or have past end-points on ~/K [2,4]. Since the generator 2 of J+ (Y) through q would enter D + (5 e) it would have to have an end point on Y since otherwise it would intersect 5 e and pass into the past of 5 e which would be impossible, as 3- is to the future of 6 °. The generator 2 would intersect g" orthogonally. However, as ~zis a closed trapped surface, the null geodesics orthogonal to J- are converging. Together with the weak energy condition: TabKaK b 2> 0 for any timelike vector K a, this implies that there will be a point conjugate to ~- within a finite affine length on any null geodesic orthogonal to J" [4]. Points on such a geodesic beyond the conjugate point will tie in  Black Holes in General Relativity 155 Singulclrity ~Cotlapsing -closed trapped SUF/Qce "Event hoizon 2Grn Fig. 1. Spherical collapse the interior of J+(~--) and not on its boundary [2,4]. However the generator 2 of J+(Y-) would have infinite affine length from Y- to J+ since J+ is at infinity. This establishes a contradiction which shows that Y- does not intersect J-(J+). Thus the future incomplete geodesic in J+(Y') is not visible from J+. Since J- (J+) does not contain Y, its boundary J- (J+) must be nonempty. This is the event horizon for J+ and is the boundary of the region from which particles or photons can escape to infinity. It is generated by null geodesic segments which have no future end-points. The convergence Q of these generators cannot be positive. For suppose it were positive on some open set og of J-(J+). Let ff be a spacelike 2-surface in all. Then the outgoing null geodesics orthogonal to ~- would be converging. One could deform a small part of ~" so that it intersected J-(J +) but so that the outgoing null geodesics orthogonal to ff were still converging. This again would lead to a contradiction since the null geodesics orthogonal to ff could not remain in J + (if) all the way out to J+. If there were a point on the event horizon which was not in D+(5~), the future Cauchy development of 5 ~, a small perturbation could result in there being points near J+ which were not in D+(Y). Since I am assuming that asymptotic predictability is stable, I shall slightly extend the definition to exclude this kind of situation. In an asymptotically predictable space J+(50)c~J-(J +) is in D+(50). I shall say that such a space is strongly asymptotically predictable if in addition J+ (50)c~ J(J +) is in D + (50). In such a space one can construct a family 5Qt)(t>0) of partial Cauchy surfaces in D ÷ (5 °) such that (a) for t2 > tl, Y(t2)C J+(50(tx)); (b) each 50(t) intersects S + in a 2-sphere sJ(t); (c) for each t> 0, 50(t)w[J + c~J-(~(t))] is a Cauchy surface for D+(50). The construction is as follows. Choose a suitable family ~'(t) of 2-spheres on J+. Put a volume measure on ~ so that the total volume of J//in this measure is finite [7]. Define the functions f(p) and h(p,t), p eD+(50) as the volumes of J+(p)r~D+(50) and [J-(p)-J-(d(t))]nD+(5 ~) respectively. They will be continuous in p and t. The surface 50(0 is then defined to be the set of points p such that h(p, t) = tf(p). For sufficiently large t, the surfaces 50(t) will intersect the event horizon and so ~(t) defined as Y(t)-J(J+) will be nonempty. I shall define a black hole on the surface 50(t) to be a connected component of M(t). In other words, it is a region of 50(0 from which there is no escape to ~+. As time increases, black holes may merge together and new black holes may be created by further bodies collapsing but a black hole can never bifurcate. For suppose the black hole Nl(t~) on the surface 50(tl) divided into two black holes ~2(t2) and ~3(tz) by a later surface 50(t2). Then N2(t2) and N3(t2) would each have to contain points of J+ (N1 (t0). However every nonspacelike curve which intersected ¢)~(ta) would intersect 50(t2). Therefore J + (~ 1 (t 1)) c~ 5 °(t2) would be connected and would be contained in N2(t2)w~3(tz). Suppose that ~ is initially nonsingular in the sense that J-(50), the region to the past of 50, is isometric to a region to the past of a Cauchy surface in an asymptotically simple space [2]. Then for small values of t, the surfaces S(t) will be compact. However the surfaces 50(t) are homeomorphic to each other for all t > 0 and so they will all be compact. This implies that the boundary ~M ~ (t) of a black hole N l(t) will be compact. Since the generators of J-(J+) have no future end points and have convergence 0 <0, the surface area of ~(t) cannot decrease with t. If two black holes ~t(tt) and ~2(t~) on the surface 50(t~) merge to form a single black hole ~3(tz) on a later surface 50(tz), then the area of ~a(tl) must be at least the sum of the areas of 00~(tl) and ~)2(tl). In fact it must be strictly greater than this sum because (?Y)s(tz) contains two disjoint closed sets which correspond to the generators of J(J+) which intersect ~l(tl) and ?~z(tl). Since ON3(tz) is connected, it must also contain an open set of points which correspond to generators which  have past end points between t2 and t 1. These results wilt be used in the next section to place certain limits on the possible behaviour of black holes. 3. Stationary Black Holes In a collapse that was strongly asymptotically predictable one would expect the solution outside the event horizon to become stationary eventually. This suggests that one should study exactly stationary solutions containing black holes in the hope that one of these will represent the final state of a collapsed system. In this section I shall therefore consider spaces which satisfy the following conditions: (i) They are weakly asymptotically simple. (ii) There exists a one parameter isometry group ~b~: J¢--. Jg whose Killing vector K a is timelike near J+ and J- (iii) There exist both a past event horizon J + (J-) and a future event horizon J- (J+). (iv) There exists a partial Cauchy surface 5O from which the exterior region Y+(J-)c~3"-(J +) can be determined, i.e. the exterior region is contained in D + (5O)w D-(5°), the Cauchy development of 5O. (v) The two event horizons J+(J-) and J-(J+) intersect in a compact surface .~-.  In a real situation where an initially nonsingular body collapses there will not of course be any past event horizon, since that part of the space will be inside the body and so will be different and will be nonstationary. The statement that a past horizon exists is therefore to be understood as a condition on the analytic continuation of the stationary solution to which the real solution tends. Except in certain limiting cases, one can prove that provided there are no singularities in the exterior region, there will indeed be a past horizon which will intersect the future horizon. Penrose however has questioned whether it is reasonable to assume the nonexistence of naked singularities in the unphysical past region of the analytic extension. In fact the results that will be given in this paper can be obtained without assuming anything about the behaviour of the solution in the past though the proofs are then considerably more complicated. They will be given in [3]. Israel [8] has shown that a space which satisfies conditions (i)-(v) must be the Schwarzschitd solution if it also satisfies the following conditions: (vi) It is empty, i.e. Tab = 0. (vii) It is static and not merely stationary, i.e. the Killing vector K" is hypersurface orthogonal so rlabCdKbKc;e = O.  (viii) The gradient of KaK, is not zero anywhere outside the horizon. This means that there is no neutral point at which a particle can remain at rest outside the black hole. Carter [9] has considered spaces which satisfy conditions (i)-(vi) and (ix) are axisymmetric. (x) The surface ~" which is the intersection of the two horizons has the topology S 2. He shows that such spaces fall into disjoint families, each depending on at most two parameters m and a. The parameter m represents the mass of the black hole as measured from infinity and the parameter a is hc/Gm where h is the angular momentum as measured from infinity. One such family is known, namely the Kerr solutions with a 2 < m 2 [10]. It seems unlikely that there are any others. It has therefore been conjectured that, at least in a collapse that does not deviate too much from spherical symmetry, the solution outside the horizon tends to one of the Kerr solutions with a2< m 2. I shall here give further support to this conjecture by justifying condition (ix), that is, I shall show that a rotating black hole must be axisymmetric if it satisfies conditions (i)-(v). Condition (x) will be justified in the next section. I shall assume that the matter in the space satisfies the weak energy condition and obeys well behaved hyperbolic equations such as Maxwell's equations or those for a scalar field. It then follows that the solution must be analytic near infinity where the Killing vector is timelike [11]. I shall take the solution elsewhere to be the analytic continuation of this region near infinity. The idea is now to consider the solution immediately to the future of the surface F of intersection of the two horizons (Fig. 2). This is determined by Cauchy data on the two horizons. By analyticity the solution in this region determines the local nature of the solution everywhere else. I shall show that the Cauchy data on the intersecting horizons is invariant under a continuous group which leaves the intersection surface ff invariant but moves points on one horizon along the null generators of the horizon towards ~- and moves points on the other horizon along the generators away from ff (Fig. 3). From the uniqueness of the Cauchy problem it then follows that the solution must admit a Killing vector field which on the horizon is directed along the null generators. However, in general, the Killing vector field K a which is timelike near infinity will be spacelike on the horizon. There must thus be two independent Killing vector fields and a two parameter isometry group. Near infinity the extra symmetry will have the character of a Poincar6 transformation. Since a black hole in asymptotically flat space is not invariant under a space translation or a Lorentz boost, the extra symmetry must correspond to a spatial rotation and so the solution will  be axisymmetric. Carter [12] has shown that in a stationary axisymmetric asymptotically flat space, the two Killing vectors must commute. To show that the Cauchy data on the horizons is invariant under a group, I shall first show that the null generators of the horizons have zero convergence 0 and shear ~r (see [13] for definitions). For this purpose consider a spacelike 2-sphere cg on J-. The family of surfaces off(t) - ~bt(Cg) obtained by moving E along the Killing vector K a will cover J-. Let 2 be a null geodesic generator of the future horizon J-(J+) which intersects ~,~. The strong causality condition [14] will hold on the compact set Y since it is in the Cauchy development of 5 e. This means that 2 must leave o~ and so must leave J+(J-) and enter J+(J-). Suppose there were some t' such that 2 did not intersect J+ (cg(t')). Then for any t, the  generator ~b~(2) would not intersect J+((g(t'+ t)). Since ~ is compact there would be a point q s ~ which was a limit point of ~ c~ 4~(2) as t ~ - oe and there would be a null direction at q which was a limit of the direction of the ~b~(2). The future directed null geodesic from q in this direction would lie in J-(~¢+) because J-(J+) is a closed set and its generators have no future end-points. Thus it would enter J+(J--). However it could not intersect J+ (cg(t)) for any t since it was a limit of the q5~(2) as t~ - oe. This establishes a contradiction which shows that 2 must intersect J+ (~g(t))for every t. The generators of J-(J+) which intersect N form a compact set invariant under 4~t. Let 50(0 be the 2-surface which is the intersection of these generators with J+(cg(t)). As t increases, ~(t) will move to the future along the generators of J-(J+). The convergence Q of these generators is less than or equal to zero. If it were less than zero anywhere the area of ~(t) would increase. However the area of 2'(t) must remain the same since it is moving under the isometry ~bt. Thus q= Ia;bnaaN b = 0 where I" is the null tangent vector to the generators of J-(J+) and na a and/~ are complex conjugate null vectors orthogonal to 1 a with m~r~ = -1. It then follows from the weak energy condition that the shear ~r=la;bnaana b, Ricci tensor component (boo=-½Rabl"l b and Weyl tensor component ~Po = - ~f, bcd P nab IC nad are zero on J- (~¢ +) [13]. Similarly the corresponding quantities # = --n,;bNana b, 2 = --n,,bNa~ b, ~b22 = -- )Rabn"n b and ~P4 = - C~bcd naNbncNd must be zero on J+(J-) where n" is the null vector tangent to the generators of J+(J-) and naa and n5 ~ are orthogonal to n,. For the empty space Einstein equations the Cauchy data is determined by ho o on J-(J+), tp4 on J+(J-) and Q, # and ~P2 =--½C, bcd(pnbl~nd+ l~nbna~N d) on the intersection surface ~ [19, 16]. Apart from tP2, these quantities are all zero in the present case. At ~- one can normalise/" and n ~ by/"n~ = 1 and one can then parallelty propagate them and na" and N" up the horizons. There remains the freedom P-+ e"l ", n"-~e-~n" where u is a function on ~. If u is not constant on ~,~ the rotation coefficient e + fi= l,;bn"N b will be changed by this transformation. However if u is constant all the rotation coefficients and Riemann tensor components will be unchanged under this transformation if one moves from a point on J-(J+) an affine distance v from ~ to a point on the same generator an affine distance e-"v from ~,~. Similarly everything is unchanged on J+(J-) if one moves from an affine distance of w to one of e"w. This means that the Cauchy data on the horizon is invariant the one parameter transformation 0, which leaves .~- invariant and is generated by the vector fields -vP and wn ~ on J-(,~+) and J+(J-) respectively. The solution determined by the Cauchy data will therefore admit an isometry group 0, whose Killing vector K" will coincide with -vP or wn" on the horizons.  Black Holes  In the case of the Einstein equations with a scalar field, the additional Cauchy data needed is the value of the field on the two horizons. As cb o 0 and ~22 are zero, the field must be constant along each generator. The Cauchy data is thus invariant under the transformation 0, in this case also. For the Einstein-Maxwell equations the additional data is Fablam b on J-(J+), Fabn~ b on J+(J-) and F~b(lanb+mam b) on ~-. However the first two are zero as ~boo and ~b22 are zero and the third is invariant under 0,. Similar results will hold for other well behaved fields. The Killing vector K ~ will be tangent to the horizons since they are invafiants under the isometry ~t. Thus on the horizons it will either be directed along the null generators or it will be spacelike. The former will be the situation if the solution is not only stationary but static [-17]. In this case the Killing vectors K" and/(a will coincide. However one can appeal to Israel's results [8, 18] to show that the solution must be spherically symmetric if it is either empty or contains only a Maxwell field. If the solution is not static but only stationary and is empty, one can generalise a result of Lichnerowitz [19] to show that there wilt be a region where K a is spacelike. (Details will be given in [3].) Part, at least, of this region will be outside the horizon. If the horizon is contained in this region, the Killing vectors K a and /~a will be distinct and so the solution will be axisymmetric. A particle travelling along a null geodesic generator of the horizon would be moving with respect to the stationary frame, i.e. the integral curves of K ~. Thus, in a sense, the horizon would be rotating with respect to infinity. One can therefore say that any rotating black hole which satisfies conditions (i)-(v) must be axisymmetric. There remains the possibility that there could be stationary, nonstatic solutions in which the horizon was not rotating but in which K a was spacelike in a region outside and disjoint from the horizon. In such a situation there would have to be neutral points outside the horizon where K" was timelike and the gradient of K"K~ was zero. I have not been able to rule out this possibility but it seems to be unstable in that one could extract an indefinitely large amount of energy by a method proposed by Penrose [20]: consider a small particle with momentum p] = ml~ where rnl is the mass and v{ is the future directed unit tangent vector to the world-line. If the particle moves on a geodesic its energy E 1 = p{ K~ will be constant. Suppose that the particle were to fall from infinity into the region where K" was spacelike and there divided into two particles momenta p~ and p~. By local conservation, p{ = p~ + p~. Since K" was spacelike, one could arrange that E 2 = p"zK~ was negative. Then E 3 > E 1 and particle 3 could escape to infinity, where its total energy (rest-mass plus kinetic) would be greater than that of the original particle. Particle 2 on the other hand would have to remain in the region  where K" was spacelike and so could neither escape to infinity nor fall through the horizon. By repeating this process many times one could gradually extract energy from the solution. As one did this the solution would presumably change gradually. However the region where K" is spacelike could not disappear since there would have to be somewhere for the negative energy particles to go. If it remained disjoint from the horizon, one would apparently extract an indefinite amount of energy. If, on the other hand, the region moved so that it included the horizon, K" and/~" would be distinct and so, suddenly, the solution would be axisymmetric. I therefore feel that such a situation will not occur and that any stationary, nonstatic, black hole will be axisymmetric. It is worth noting that the field equations did not play a very important part in the above argument. Thus one can apply it also to the case of a rotating black hole surrounded by a ring of matter. The solution will not be analytic at the ring but it will be elsewhere, and so the above result will still hold. At first sight this seems to lead to a paradox. Consider a rotating star surrounded by a non-rotating square frame of rods. Suppose that the star collapsed to produce a rotating black hole. From the above it appears that the solution ought to become axisymmetric. However the presence of the square frame will prevent this. The answer seems to be that the field of the frame will distort the rotating black hole slightly. The reaction of the rotating black hole back on the frame will cause it to start rotating and so to radiate gravitational waves. Eventually the rotation of both the black hole and the frame will be damped out and the solution will approach a static state in which K" and K" coincide and which therefore does not have to be axisymmetric. I am grateful to James B. Hartle and Brandon Carter for suggesting this solution to the paradox. 4. The Topology of the Event Horizon In this section I shall prove that each connected component of the 2-surface 5°(0 in the event horizon has the topology S 2. This is done by showing that, if it had any other topology, one could deform it outwards into the exterior region in such a way that the future directed outgoing null geodesics orthogonal to it would be converging. As in Section 2, this would lead to a contradiction. Let I a be the future directed null vector tangent to the future event horizon and let n" be the other future directed null vector orthogonal to 5~(t) normalized so that l~na = 1 but with the freedom l"~eap, na-~e-~n" not restricted for the moment. Now move each point of 5o(t) an affine distance - w along the null geodesics with tangent vector n °. This moves 5o(t) to the past into J-(J+). To keep P orthogonal to the 2-surface, it  small negative value of w' one would obtain a 2-surface in J-(3"+) such that the outgoing null geodesics orthogonal to the surface were converging. This would lead to a contradiction. Suppose now that 5~ was zero and that g't~+3A was zero on the horizon. Then one could choose a so that the sum of the last four terms in Eq. (2) was zero everywhere on £f(t). If 1,o 2 was nonzero somewhere on 5¢(t), the term - z'g' in Eq. (2) would be nonzero and one could change d , a slightly so as to make dwTw, Q negative everywhere on 5¢(t). This would again lead to a contradiction. If, on the other hand, 11) 2 was zero everywhere on ~(t), the Cauchy data would be zero and so the solution would be flat. One could not have a flat toroidal horizon in a flat space which is Euclidean at infinity. This shows that Lf(t) and hence ~,~ has spherical topology. It has not been excluded that 5e(t) might have several disconnected components, each topologically spheres, which represent separate black holes at constant distance from each other along the axis of symmetry. For reasons explained in the next section I think this could occur only in the limiting case where the black holes have a charge q = + G}m. 5. Energy Limits In view of the previous two sections, it seems reasonable to assume that in a gravitational collapse the solution outside the horizon settles down into a Kerr solution with a z < m 2. If the collapsing body had a net electrical charge of q e.s.u., one would expect the solution to settle down to a charged Kerr solution [10] with a 2 +e 2 <m 2 where e--G--~q. One would therefore expect the area of the 2-surface 0N(t) in the horizon to approach the area of a 2-surface in the horizon of the Kerr solution. This area is 4~G2 c-4(2m z - e 2 + 2m(m z - a 2 - e2)~). (6) Consider a black hole which by a surface 5P(t) has settled down to a Kerr solution with parameters m 1, a 1 and el. Suppose the black hole now interacts with various particles or fields and then settles down again by a surface 5P(t ') to a Kerr solution with parameters m2, a2 and e 2. From Section 2 it follows that the area of (?N(t') is greater than or equal to the area of ~N(t). In fact it must be strictly greater if there is any disturbance at the event horizon. Thus  Note that m2 can be less than m~ if a~ or e t are nonzero. One can interpret this as meaning that one can extract rotational or electrostatic energy  from a black hole. One way of extracting rotational energy would be to construct an asymmetric frame of rods around the black hole. According to the argument in Section 3, the frame would start rotating and would emit gravitational waves until the rotation of the black hole was damped out. Another way of extracting energy would be to use the fact that the Killing vector K a is spacelike on and in a region just outside the event horizon. One could then employ the procedure described in Section 3 of sending in a particle and getting one back with greater energy. In this case the negative energy particles could fall through the horizon. Christodoulou [22] has shown that using this process one can get arbitrarily near the limit set by inequality (7). Using charged particles one can extract electrostatic energy from a black hole. By lowering a particle of the opposite charge down the axis on a rope one can get arbitrarily near the limit set by (7). Consider now a situation in which two stars a long way apart collapse to form black holes Nl(t) and ~2(t). One can neglect the interaction between them and take the areas of (~l(t) and aY)a(t) to be given by formula (6) with the values of the parameters ml, al, el and m2, a2, e2 respectively. Suppose the two black holes now collide and merge to form a single black hole N3 (t'). This process will give rise to a certain amount of gravitational radiation and, if the black holes are charged, of electromagnetic radiation as well. By the conservation law for weakly asymptotically simple space-times [23], the energy of this radiation is (ma + m2 - m3) c 2. This is limited by the requirement that the area of 0~3(t' ) must be greater than the sum of the areas of ~?N'l(t ) and c~9¢2(t ). This gives the inequality  The fraction e = (m~ + m2)-l(m 1 + m 2 - m3) of energy radiated is always less than 1 -2 -~. If el and e2 are zero or have the same sign, then e < 1. If, in addition, a 1 = a 2 = 0, then e < 1 - 2 -~. By the conservation of charge, e 3 = e I + e 2. Angular momentum, on the other hand, can be carried off by the radiation. This cannot happen however if the situation is axisymmetric, i.e. if the black holes have their rotation axes aligned along their direction of approach to each other. Then m3a 3 = m~a~ + m2a z. It can be seen that if the angular momenta have the same sign there is less energy available to be radiated than if they have opposite signs. This suggests that there may be a spin dependent force between two black holes as indeed one might expect from the analogy between angular momentum and magnetic dipole moment. Unlike the electrodynamic case, the force would be attractive if the  angular momenta had opposite directions and repulsive if they had the same direction. However, even in the limiting case rn 1 = m2 = al = a2, it is still possible to radiate some energy. This suggests that the repulsive force is never strong enough to balance the attractive force between the masses. It seems that the only way to obtain a strong enough repulsive force is to go to the other limiting case in which mt = ei, mz = e2 and al = a 2 = 0. Hartle and I [24] have found static solutions containing two or more such black holes.   	 It is assumed that the singularities which occur in gravitational collapse are not visible from outside but are hidden behind an event horizon. This means that one can still predict the future outside the event horizon. A black hole on a spacelike surface is defined to be a connected component of the region of the surface bounded by the event horizon. As time increase, black holes may merge together but can never bifurcate. A black hole would be expected to settle down to a stationary state. It is shown that a stationary black hole must have topologically spherical boundary and must be axisymmetric if it is rotating. These results together with those of Israel and Carter go most of the way towards establishing the conjecture that any stationary black hole is a Kerr solution. Using this conjecture and the result that the surface area of black holes can never decrease, one can place certain limits on the amount of energy that can be extracted from black holes.
5	1991	String theory and black holes	Edward Witten 	String theory and black holes An exact conformal field theory describing a black hole in two-dimensional space-time is found as an SL(2,R)/U(1) gauged Wess-Zumino-Witten model. For k =9/4, the conformal field theory can be regarded as a classical solution of the same system that is probed in the c =1 matrix model. The conformal field theory governing the space-time is regular at the Riemannian singularity, but it appears that generic perturbations blow up there. It is argued that the end point of the Hawking black-hole evaporation is the standard space-time of the c =1 matrix model, which should be regarded as an analog of the extreme Reissner-Nordstrom black hole of four-dimensional general relativity. The c = 1 model is thus a model of the quantum mechanics of rnatter interacting with a black hole. Two-dimensional current algebra with a noncompact symmetry group is nonunitary, but nonetheless it has been known for some time that some cosets [1,2] of noncompact groups are unitary at least in that one can find unitary representations of the appropriate chiral algebras. This was first found for SL(2,E)/U(1) cosets [3] which have been studied considerably along with their generalizations [4—6]. (It was proposed in [4] that such a model would have an interpretation in two-dimensional target space-time. ) There has been, however, little success at forming modular-invariant combinations of left- and right-moving SL(2,E)/U(1) representations, nor has there been much insight about what would be the content of a such a hypothetical theory. Gauged Wess-Zumino-Witten (WZW) models are a natural framework [2,7—10] for giving a Lagrangian (and hence manifestly modular-invariant) realization of coset models. In this paper we will construct a modularinvariant SL(2,E)/U(1) coset model as a gauged WZW model. What we will get is a conformal field theory describing a black hole in a two-dimensional target space-time. Depending on which subgroup we gauge, we obtain a Euclidean black hole or its Lorentzian continuation. Although it is not necessarily easy, the conformal field theory governing the black hole is presumably more or less exactly soluble because of the extended chiral algebra of SL(2,IR)/U(1). Different forms of the solution we will be discussing have been obtained (without the black-hole interpretation) by Bardakci et al. and by Rocek et al. (who found another real form of the solution in studying SU(2)/U(1) and SU(2) XU(1) WZW models, respectively [11,12]), and by Mandal et al. [13] (who found the part of the spacetime exterior to the horizon by studying the O(a') /3- function equations for string theory with a twodimensional target space). The black hole is also reminiscent of instanton and soliton solutions found by Callan, Harvey, and Strominger [14]. Black-hole solutions of limiting low-energy field theories derived from string theory in four (or more) dimensions have been analyzed in several papers [ 15—18 ]. Although we will consider in this paper only the bo sonic theory, there is also a superconformal version of the black-hole solution. It can be found by gauging a supersymmetric SL(2,E) WZW model. (One starts with an iV=1 WZW model, but the resulting coset model turns out to have N =2 supersymmetry, as in the construction of Kazama and Suzuki [19].) The superconformal black hole is a kind of analytical continuation of the N =2 discrete series, which can be described by an analogous supersymmetric SU(2)/U(l) coset. The central charge of the SL(2,E)/U(1) model is [3 [This formula originates as follows. The central charge of SU(2) current algebra at level k is 3k /(0+2). Analytically continuing from SU(2) to SL(2,E) would by itself not change the value of c extracted from Feynman diagrams, since minus signs in vertices cancel against minus signs in propagators. However, in passing from SU(2) to SL(2,IR), one takes k —& —k since we want the SL(2,IR) manifold to have signature ( —++) and not (+——). This gives the 3k/(k —2). Finally, one subtracts 1 for the gauged U(1).] There are two interesting regions. For k~ ~, the o. model describing the black hole is weakly coupled and can be understood semiclassically (in the world-sheet sense). To obtain a bosonic string background, one must then adjoin additional matter of c near 24. Alternatively, for k =—', the black hole has c =26 and can be considered as a bosonic string background in its own right. As we will see, it is asymptotic at spatial infinity to the two-dimensional space-time that appears in the standard c=1 matrix model [22—25]. (The latter model superficially has a one-dimensional target space, but in fact is naturally understood [20,21] in terms of a two-dimensional target space-time, the second dimension being the Liouville mode. ) We will suggest later that the black hole plays a key role in the physics of the c =1 model. This may be related to the fact that Liouville theory and some of its generalizations arise as other SL(2,E) cosets [26—28]. The ungauged SL(2,IR) WZW action is  Here X is a Riemann surface with metric tensor h, g:X~SL(2,E) is the field variable of the model, Tr is the trace in the two-dimensional representation of SL(2,E), k is a positive real number [as noted above, the sign of the Lagrangian has been reversed compared to the SU(2) case], and I is the Wess-Zumino term [29]. The latter can be described as follows [30]. If B is a threemanifold with boundary X, and we pick an extension of g to a map from Bto SL(2,E), which we also call g, then Because the gauge group has been chosen to act freely, one can conveniently fix the gauge by gauging away one component of g (such a gauge choice is often called a unitary gauge). The gauge invariance can be precisely fixed by setting  As the Lagrangian is quadratic in 2, and the quadratic piece is invertible and nonderivative, A can be integrated out, to give (The Wess-Zumino term is a total derivative in this gauge and has been dropped. ) As tanhr ~1 for large r, it is easy to see that the target space metric of this theory, has the form (Fig. 1) of a semi-infinite cigar, asymptotic for r~ ~ to RXS' with a Rat metric. In general, a ddimensional Euclidean black hole is asymptotic to R" 'XS', so this space-time is a candidate for interpre- symmetry corresponding to g ~agb ', with a, bCSL(2, E). Usually it is possible to gauge an arbitrary subgroup of the global symmetry group of a theory, but for WZW models, that is not possible, because of the peculiar nature of the Wess-Zumino term. Only subgroups that obey a certain condition of anomaly cancellation can be gauged. We first wish to consider the gauging of an anomaly-free subgroup chosen to remove the negative signature mode of g so as to get a Euclidean signature conformal field theory. We consider the U(1) subgroup generated infinitesimally by To gauge this symmetry we introduce an Abelian gauge field 3 with The gauge-invariant generalization of the WZW action is in local complex coordinates z, z (here d z denotes the measure ~dz dz~) tation as such a black hole. Before discussing this further, let us note the following conundrum: the metric (9) is certainly not fiat, and therefore it is not Ricci fiat (as the two concepts coincide in two dimensions), so how can the P function vanish even in the one-loop approximation, which is valid for large k? In problems of roughly this type [32] (and in this precise problem for a different real form of the metric [12]) it is known that a finite correction coming from the measure in the integration over A gives rise to a target space dilaton field, a more accurate representation of the classical action for r and 0 being I( the analysis of [32],4 can be determined by noting that it must obey the one-loop equation [33] The possibility of adding a constant to 4 amounts to the freedom to change the string coupling constant. This additive constant plays an important role, as we wi11 see later. N grows linearly for large r, with a sign such that the string coupling constant vanishes for r~oo. If one assumes that (10) represents an exact conformal field theory for all k, then the central charge can be computed by going to the asymptotically Aat region of large r. Including in the standard fashion [34] the shift in c due to the correction in the stress tensor that comes from the asymptotically linear dilaton field (12), one gets c =2+6/k. This agrees with the exact answer (1) only to within an error of order 1/k . This must mean that there are further corrections to the Lagrangian (10), presumably coming from additional contributions to the result obtained in integrating out A. Our point of view is that the exact black-hole quantum field theory is represented by the gauged WZW Lagrangian (6). The transformation to unitary gauge is difficult to carry out exactly, but is very useful for getting a qualitative picture of the physics. Unfortunately, the value k= —' at which c=26 is in the strong-coupling region, and without a better understanding, it is difficult to determine such properties as the radius of the circle at infinity. We will express some of the formulas in terms of not k but k'=k —2. There is no loss in making this substitution, since perturbation theory in 1/k can be rearranged as perturbation theory in 1/k'. One advantage in expressing the formulas in terms of k' rather than k is that this gives the right results for things that are controlled by the asymptotic behavior of the dilaton field (since this is known in view of its relation to the central charge). The simple substitution of k by k' in (10), is not, however, guaranteed to give the right value of the asymptotic radius of the cigar. Let us now compare to Liouville theory. Liouville theory coupled to c =1 matter has a two-dimensional space-time interpretation [20,21] with coordinates $, e and a world-sheet action that reads, in part, P is the Liouville field; the string coupling constant is weak for P~ oo and strong for P~ —~. (To compare to Ref. [20], one should set a'=2, while in the rest of this paper we will set a'= —, '.) It is convenient (and, according to matrix model results, possibly necessary) to add a tachyon potential to the action to suppress the strongly coupled region at P~ —oo. Comparing (10) and (13), we see that, for large r, r can be identified with the Liouville field P. But a cutofF to dynamically suppress the region of r~ —~ is unnecessary, since this region is missing from the black hole space-time. Because of this, the region k ) —, ', which corresponds to what is usually regarded as the forbidden region of c ) 1 in Liouville theory, makes perfect sense for the Euclidean black hole. In a sense, replacing standard Liouville theory with the Euclidean black hole could be regarded as a way of getting past the Liouville theory barrier at c =1. To understand the relation between the black hole at k =—', and the c =1 matrix mode1, it is usefu1 to first understand the general relation between critical strings with a D-dimensional target space and noncritica1 strings with a (D —1)-dimensional target space. A noncritical string in D —1 dimensions (i.e., two-dimensional gravity without conformal invariance, coupled to a (D —1)- dimensional cr model) can always be interpreted as a critical string in D dimensions with the Liouville field as the Dth dimension. It is obvious though not always emphasized that the reverse mapping is possible only under special circumstances. This is evident from any clear statement of what the reverse map means when it exists. Consider a D-dimensional target space model with If one considers the naive conformal transformation law then one finds at the one-loop level that the effective action is not invariant; rather,  Suppose, however, that there is a function 4 on the target space such that R,b =D,Db@. Then [33] one adds to the action a counterterm  Combining (17) and (19) we see that if we start with the action l=IO+I&, then up to this order the effective action is conformally invariant modulo the equation of motion h'~D, D X'=0. Instead of speaking of conformal invariance modulo the equations of motion, it is much better to modify the conformal transformation laws to achieve invariance off shell. The modified transformation laws, which are adequate up to this order, are There are presumably further corrections in higher order. From (20) one can determine the conditions under which a D-dimensional critical string theory can be deduced from a (D —1 )-dimensional noncritical string theory. If the gradient of the dilaton is everywhere timelike, then one can use conformal transformations to gauge away a time coordinate, by fixing a gauge in which, say, X =0. In this way time is eliminated in favor of the determinant of the two-dimensional metric. Similarly, if the gradient of the dilaton is everywhere spacelike, then one can use conformal transformations to fix a gauge such as X'=0, eliminating one of the space coordinates in favor of the determinant of the metric. However, this identification of a D-dimensional critical string theory with a (D —1)-noncritical string theory will fail in the (typical) case in which the gradient of the dilaton is neither everywhere spacelike nor everywhere timelike. For instance, in the case of the Euclidean black hole, the transformation laws in this approximation are For r ))0 this is approximately the Liouville transformation law 5r =e X const which would assert that a power of e' can be identified with the determinant of the metric. In that region, r can be gauged away, and the system can be described as noncritical two-dimensional gravity coupled to a single scalar field 0. Near r =0, however, the attempt to gauge away r in favor of the determinant of the metric is not valid, since V@=0 at r=0. Hence, though for k = —, ' the Euclidean black hole is a classical solution of the same theory that is usually studied in the c =1 matrix model, it cannot actually be regarded as a theory of c =1 matter coupled to two-dimensional gravity. Later, when we construct the Lorentz signature black hole, it will be apparent that the situation is much worse: the gradient of the dilaton is spacelike outside the horizon, and timelike inside, so if one tried to represent this system as noncritical two-dimensional gravity coupled to c =1 matter, one would obtain a dreadful mess. Now let us discuss the analytic continuation of the black hole to a Lorentz signature. Naively, one simply Notice that in this continuation, it is 0, not r, that is rotated, so we are committed to interpreting the "Liouville" coordinate r as a spatial coordinate. (For the c =1 model considered in isolation, the Liouville mode can be given a spatial interpretation favored in [20] or a time interpretation assum. ed by some other authors. The blackhole physics corresponds to the spatial interpretation. The black hole does not have another analytic continuation in which r would be rotated instead of P.) Equation (22) appears to have a singularity at r =0, but this must be purely a coordinate singularity, since the scalar curvature  Now we can easily see the essential features of the spacetime. The original r, t asymptotically Aat half-space corresponds to region I in Fig. 2. The coordinate singularity at r =0 corresponds to the two lines u =0 and v =0. The physical singularity is at uv= 1 [where the curvature blows up according to (23)] and consists of a past and future branch. The future branch is the black-hole singularity, from which no signal can cross the horizon to an observer in region I. The past branch is a naked singularity. There is also a second asymptotically Aat half-space, region III. No signal can propagate from region I to region III or vice versa. Regions I—IV, and the causal relations between them, have precise analogs in the (positive mass) Schwarzschild solution in four dimensions. Finally, if one considers the space-time (28) for uv ) 1, one finds two additional asymptotically Rat half-spaces, regions V and VI. Time Aows sideways in these spaces [because the factor 1/(I —uv) changes sign in crossing uv= 1]. The singularity at uv =1, rather than being in the past or future, as appears to be the case to an ob server in one of regions I—IV, appears at the end of the spatial world to an observer in region V or VI and is a naked singularity. From the analog of the ADM definition of mass that we will compute later, the reader can verify that regions V and VI are space-times with negative mass; indeed, they are analogs of the negative mass Schwarzschild solution in four dimensions. As has occasionally been noted [36], such regions with negative mass naked singularities appear in the four-dimensional Schwarzschild solution if one continues past the singularity. As in the case of the four-dimensional Schwarzschild solution, this space-time (or more exactly regions I—IV) can be considered to develop from smooth initial data on a nonsingular Cauchy hypersurface such as u =—v. In contrast with the four-dimensional case in which such a hypersurface necessarily has an exotic topology, here the initial value surface is just a copy of R and so is not distinct topologically from a possible initial value surface in the standard two-dimensional space-time of the c =1 model. What is exotic about the initial data is the following. The dilaton field @=in cosh r =ln(1 —uu ) grows at each end of the spatial world. If, therefore, we parametrize the initial value surface u =—v by an arclength coordinate r" [so that its metric is (dr") ], then for r" &)0, r" looks like the Liouville field, while for r" «0, it looks like —r" is the Liouville field. Obvious ly, there is no simple way to straighten out the disagreement between observers at the two ends about whether r" or —r" is the approximate Liouville field. Collapse to a black hole is the result. It seems plausible that any initial conditions with the dilaton growing at each end will lead to a black-hole collapse. Now that we have exhibited the two asymptotically Bat regions of the system, perhaps it is worth mentioning that if one wishes to have a conformal field theory describing a world with only one such region, one can do this by taking an orbifold of this space-time, dividing by the Z2 group u+-+v. Instead of obtaining the Lorentz signature black hole by a purely formal analytic continuation from Euclidean space, one can obtain it directly as a conformal field theory by gauging a different subgroup of SL(2,E). We consider the noncompact one parameter symmetry group generated by sion near uu =1, and FJ =8; A —8 A, . This Lagrangian is perfectly well behaved. The Lagrangian for the w-3 system by itself is a topological field theory which can be regarded as the dimensional reduction of threedimensional Abelian Chem-Simons theory (with w as the third component of A). If the Lagrangian were precisely as written, the integration over w (as explained, for instance, in [37]) would give a 5-function setting F =0, after which A could be gauged away locally and (except for global effects) the a bsys-tern would be free. The higher-order terms not written in (35) make such a procedure awkward. Instead, one can study the theory in a gauge such as gauge (iii), c); A '=0, and easily verify that there is nothing singular or pathological about the propagators or vertices near uu = 1. Gauge (iii) makes the fact that the conformal field theory is nonsingular perfectly manifest. It can also be used elsewhere in the space-time. Its only drawback is that it fails to exhibit the fact that away from the singularity the theory has an interpretation with a two-dimensional target space [as opposed to the three independent scalars and one gauge field present in (34)]. It is amusing to compare this situation with the motivation for studying topological field theories that was proposed some time ago [38]. It was felt that spacetime and world-sheet topological field theories might describe an "unbroken phase" of space-time and worldsheet general relativity, with a breakdown of the Riemannian concepts, and that such a phase might be the key to understanding quantum gravity and string theory. The singularity of a black hole is one place where one might expect Riemannian notions to fail, and we have indeed found a conformal field theory in which the "physics" at the singularity cannot be understood in two-dimensional Riemannian geometry, and in which a certain triviallooking topological gauge theory is an essential piece. At this point, one might be tempted to think that the "singularity" of the black hole is completely spurious and purely a result of a bad gauge choice. I will, however, argue that this is not the right interpretation. First of all, let us make an analogy with black holes in four dimensions. The Schwarzschild solution in four dimensions has all of the six regions in Fig. 2. For a more realistic astrophysical black hole which forms from a spherically symmetric collapsing star, some of the regions are missing, but one still has parts of regions I, II, and V. In particular, one still has the question of whether signals incident on the singularity in region II should somehow be continued beyond the singularity into region V. What makes this seem implausible is that (as in our two-dimensional model), time is fiowing sideways in region V, and consequently region V cannot be considered to be in the future of region II. As a result, regardless of which way one considers to be the Aow of time in region V, if signals can Bow back and forth across the border between regions II and V, a future-going signal in region II could cross into region V and return as a past-going signal in region II, as shown in Fig. 3. This is somewhat analogous to having a closed timelike loop. As is usual with closed timelike loops, consideration of such phenomena will lead to pathologies unless one assumes the absence of life (and of FIG. 3. The region of initia1 (or Anal) data in region V is indicated, along with a hypothetical signal from region II to region V and back. macroscopic structures of all kinds). [In a space-time with closed timelike curves, solving physical equations requires putting restrictions on the initial data that are analogous to eigenvalue equations (a wave propagating about a closed timelike loop must be single valued) and are likely to be incompatible with the existence of complex structures. This is why, in the presence of closed timelike loops, if one assumed the existence of life one reaches contradictions like the possibility of killing one' s own remote ancestors. ] Indeed, given the initial data in region I (far in the past before a trapped surface forms), one cannot without solving the problem of free will predict whether a black hole will form; this could be prevented by a determined human effort to disperse the infalling matter to infinity. Thus a possible complex civilization in region V would have its very existence depend on a decision made in the "future" in region I. The contradiction cannot be stated so sharply in two dimensions, since, for instance, the formation of the black hole in region II is probably determined by the "topology" of the initial conditions (the clash as to whether r" or r" is the Liou—ville mode). Nevertheless, and despite the fact that the conformal field theory is nonsingular at uv =1, I believe that trying to use the continuation to regions V and VI as a way to resolve the physical questions associated with black holes is unattractive, for the reasons indicated above. To try to give a technical justification for not taking the continuation across uv =1 too seriously, let us consider the propagation of a small "tachyon" (the expression is a misnomer in D =2) disturbance in the black-hole background. Because of the underlying SL(2,R)/U(1) chiral algebra, it may be possible to solve exactly for the tachyon vertex operators, but we will simply consider perturbation theory in 1/k. This approximation is not necessarily reliable, as it might break down in the region of high curvature near uv =1. We will comment on that later. The tachyon field T(u, u), to lowest order, is governed by an effective action in space-time: where x =1—uv and the ellipsis denotes terms that are softer (more powers of x or less powers of d/dx) near x=0. This second-order equation has two linearly independent solutions. One is regular near x =0 and can be expanded as a power series, f(x)=1++„,a„x", and the other has a logarithmic singularity, f(x) =lnx+O(x lnx). If this result is not an artifact of the 1/k expansion, it means that generic initial data posed on a smooth initial value surface will propagate forward to a singularity at uv =1. In this case, the region uv =1, though nonsingular in the original black-hole solution, will be unstable and will become a physical singularity under a generic perturbation. Such phenomena are known in general relativity; for instance, the "inner horizon" of the Reissner-Nordstrom solution is a nonsingular locus where it is believed that a singularity would form under a generic perturbation. Naively, the dilaton formula @=In(1—uu) appears to suggest that the string coupling constant, which is weak at spatial infinity, blows up at uv=1. For the exact black-hole solution, this is certainly false; in gauge (iii) it is obvious that the string coupling constant is not anomalously strong at uu =1. It must be that in gauge (i) or (ii) the determinant of Auctuations in u and v blows up for uv —+1 in such a way as to cancel the effects of the dilaton. It may be that under a generic perturbation of the black hole, this cancellation is ruined and the string coupling constant becomes strong near the singularity. The claim that a generic perturbation blows up at uu= I can be checked in gauge (iii), where there is no reason for the 1/k expansion to be breaking down at uu = 1. In gauge (iii), the equation for the tachyon would be B,BbT+ =0, which permits in addition to a regular solution the singular solution T=ln(ab )=In(1 —uu ) that we found earlier. This, together with the potential pathologies cited earlier, is fairly convincing evidence that the physical problems of black holes should not be solved by trying to exploit the fact that the conformal field theory is nonsingular at uv =1. 0=2DI D 4+Dk+D N —8—8 These equations have a Oat solution in a world with space and time coordinates p and ~ with ds =dp —dr, @=p&8/k' . (42) C&=p+8/k'+y, g; =il;, +h,", (43) where y, h vanish for p~&n. (Here rt is the fIat-space metric, corresponding to the line element dp —dr . It is used to raise and lower indices in the linearized expressions. ) Let q; be the linearization of Q;, so Q,"=q,"+terms of higher order. The gravitational Bianchi identities imply that if the vector field v' generates an asymptotic symmetry of the space-time, then S, =q,"v is a conserved current asymptotically. The corresponding conserved charge density S is always a total divergence, so its integral, the conserved charge, can be measured as a surface term at p= oo. (This in turn implies that the linearized approximation to the equations is good enough Now, consider the physics as seen by an observer at a great distance, who ensures that he or she is at a fixed physical location by ensuring that the dilaton field that he or she observes remains fixed while the black hole evaporates. Suppose that the observer sits at a position where the dilaton field (which the observer measures by measuring the string coupling constant) is fixed at a value @0. From (49) we see that when the black hole has mass M, its distance from the observer is approximately 1/2 k' [No—ln(M&k'/2) ] . (50) Thus, the distance from the observer to the horizon diverges logarithmically as the hole evaporates. This is analogous to the case of an electrically or magnetically charged black hole in four dimensions. The mass M of such a hole in general relativity is always at least as great as the charge Q, and as one approaches the limiting value M=Q, the distance from an outside observer to the horizon diverges. What is the end point of the black-hole evaporation? For M~O, the physics as measured at a fixed R approaches more and more the idealized Oat-space solution (42). [For instance, one can see this in (49). M ~0 means a~ —Oo, and for a —+—~, one has y—+0 at any fixed R.] Thus, this fiat space solution, which is studied in the c =1 matrix model (except that we have not yet incorporated the cosmological constant) would appear to be the end point of the black-hole evaporation. Evaporation will be occurring at both ends of the hole, so the end point of the evaporation would appear to produce two copies of the standard space-time. The space-time action (40) does not have a Poincareinvariant solution. The fiat-space solution (42) seems to be its most symmetric solution. Hitherto this solution has been regarded as a somewhat mangled, anisotropic version of Minkowski space. My point is that the solution (42) is better regarded as an analog of the extreme Reissner-Nordstrom solution than as an analog of Minkowski space. This of course would make the anisotropy natural. The fact that (42) describes a space-time with M=O is no obstruction to this interpretation since the two-dimensional theory under consideration does not have a Poincare-invariant solution to which the mass of the spacetime described by (42) could be compared. The basis for regarding the idealized Oat space-time a an analog of the extreme Reissner-Nordstrom solution rather than as an analog of Minkowski space is not limited to the fact that this space-time is, naively, the end point of the Hawking process. More importantly, this space-time is on the edge of being a real black hole, with a singularity shielded by a horizon, in the following sense. Consider perturbing the fiat space-time (42) by sending in a particle of energy e from R =+~ (Fig. 4). To the right of the particle trajectory, we must describe the result by a conformal field theory describing a space-time of mass e; presumably, this will be the black-hole solution. To really see black-hole physics, it is necessary for the particle to reach the analog of the Schwarzschild radius. What plays that role in this situation? If we do form a black hole of mass e, the value of the dilaton field on the horizon will be, according to (49), If a particle (or collection of particles) of total energy e propag ates into a position given approximately by p=p(e), then, according to the classical equations, a horizon will form and the incoming particle or particles will be unable to escape. The issues that arise are just those that one might contemplate for an extreme Reissner-Nordstrom black hole in four dimensions. Either the particle tossed in from the right will be rejected before reaching its Schwarzschild radius or, if it reaches the Schwarzschild radius, a horizon will appear to form but presumably the energy involved will ultimately be reemitted as some form of Hawking radiation. Either way, what we expect to see is a quantum-mechanical S matrix, with particles coming in from the right and ultimately being ejected, in one form or another. Precisely such an S matrix has been computed recently by several groups in the c =1 matrix model I40—45]. To determine whether what is being seen in that S matrix is a reAection outside the Schwarzschild radius or Hawking radiation of particles that have fallen inside the Schwarzschild radius, we must incorporate a key feature of the c =1 model which has not so far appeared in our discussion. This is what in the context of Liouville theory is usually called the cosmological constant. The cosmological constant is a tachyon field with T(p, r)=pe ~ that can be added to the fiat solution (42) and has the effect of suppressing string propagation into the region p —+—~ where the string coupling constant would otherwise become strong. Many matrix model formulas are singular for p —+0, suggesting that there may be an instability that requires the inclusion of the cosmological constant (and perhaps will cause it to turn on spontaneously during black-hole evaporation, if not initially present). Whether or not this is so, p plays an important role in the c=1 matrix model, and one would like to know how it appears in the black-hole physics. We will now argue that the "cosmological constant" enters the black-hole physics even prior to the Hawking process as a failure of the analog of the "no-hair theorem. " In addition to the mass, there is at least one more parameter in the most general static black-hole solution. In fact, we can find this parameter in the equations for a Euclidean black hole. The parameter in question involves the tachyon field, that is, the possibility of adding to the world-sheet action a term f d x&h T(x). The tachyon field is governed in lowest order by the following space-time effective action (which we discussed before in analyzing propagation of signals near uu =1): formation. The basic point is that the existence of a black-hole solution of the graviton-dilaton field equations (41) is stable in the sense that if one adds to the equations any perturbation of rapid decay at infinity, a solution still exists, perhaps after changing the value of the asymptotic constants in the solution —the radius of the circle and the coefficient of the linear term in @. [If one did not have the exact SL(2,R)/U(1) theory, one would use an argument along precisely these lines to show that the existence of the Euclidean black hole, though not the details of the metric, is stable against corrections to the large-k' equations. The possible need to change the radius of the circle means that the Hawking temperature may depend on the cosmological constant. ] Similarly, the argument by which we predicted the existence of a regular solution of (54) with exponential decay at infinity showed that the existence of this solution is stable against small nonlinearities or changes in the dilaton-graviton background that vanish at infinity. This stability of the equations means that adding of terms quadratic and higher order in T will not affect the existence of a family of solutions labeled at least in an open set by the parameters seen in the linear analysis, so that the marginal deformation we have found will be tangent to an actual deformation. For the value k'= —, ' that corresponds to the c =1 model, A, + =A, =—&8. [These values are reliable as they depend only on the known asymptotic behavior of the dilaton field and not the unknown details of the black-hole metric. The fact that A, + = A, at k'= —' is related to the fact that in Liouville theory k'= —, ' is regarded as the largest allowed value. For k') —, ', A,+ have imaginary parts which mean that the regular solution of (54) has an oscillatory sign. This is perfectly sensible in the black-hole physics, but is considered pathological in Liouville theory since one wants a positive exponential that could represent the determinant of the metric, ] The two solutions of (54) at large p behave as e i' and pe i', as noted in [20]. The latter will dominate for large p, so the marginal deformation of the black hole looks like T-pe 1' for large p. This marginal deformation can be analytically continued to Minkowski space where, outside the horizon, it looks much like the usual tachyon background of the c =1 model. Our earlier analysis of (38) suggests that the tachyon background corresponding to the marginal deformation probably diverges at uv =1. It would be interesting to verify this, even to lowest order, by a more extensive study of (38) and (54). If it is true that the tachyon background diverges at uv =1, this would mean that in the presence of a cosmological constant, the "singularity" really is a singularity in the conformal field theory. Let us now consider a weak tachyon signal of frequency co propagating inward from p=+ ~ on the limiting black hole with a linear dilaton field of a strength corresponding to the c=1 model, that is, k'= —, '. (Or, what would be much the same thing, consider propagation toward an M )0 black hole in the region outside the horizon where the dilaton is approximately linear. ) Following [20] we assume a T term in (53) with a coefficient If we set T(p, r)=e i' e ' 'w(p) we get +8 l CO'7 d2 +co —gee i' w(p)=0 . dp The classically forbidden region is the region with ~'—gpe-~'~ &0, (59) and w(p) vanishes exponentially at smaller p. We may very crudely say, therefore, that the distance to which the wave reaches is given by p=ln(gp/co )/&8 . (60) If our wave of frequency m has an amplitude corresponding to N elementary quanta, then the energy in this wave is e =Neo. Let us now recall that the Schwarzschild distance for a system of energy e was [according to (52)] 1/2 k' p(e) = 8 1n(@&8/k') . (61) The wave will fall into the black hole if the value of p that it reaches is less than the critical value p(e). At k'= —, ', the criterion is —, 'In(Neo%'32) ))In(gp/co ) or (dropping an untrustworthy constant) )) 2/5N —1/5 (63) This criterion is not obeyed in perturbative computations in the c =1 model, where one considers co fixed, N-l, and p~~. Therefore, the usual perturbative approximation to the c =1 model apparently corresponds to a situation in which the incident particles are repelled by the tachyon potential, without really probing the blackhole physics. If the matrix model framework can be taken literally, it is certainly possible to perform nonperturbative computations (some of which in fact have been done in [40]) in the region where (63) is obeyed. The result (63) is, however, puzzling, since it is not obvious that anything interesting happens in the matrix model when co reaches a crucial value proportional to p Altogether, the existence of the black-hole solution seems to mean that the dynamics of the target space geometry must be taken seriously in the c = 1, D =2 matrix model. Once one does this, it is evident that there must be a relation between two of the strangest features of the model. The first strange feature, manifest in the matrix model description by free fermions, is the existence of infinitely many conserved quantities, associated with conserved currents of higher spin such as g+i3+g+. The second strange feature is the existence of discrete states of the string with definite energy and momentum; these states showed up in the computations of [43] and were interpreted in [44] as quasitopological modes of fields of higher spin. Despite their exponential fall-of (which rellects the role of the dilaton and the fact that the string coupling constant vanishes exponentially at infinity), the topological nature of these fields means that they are analogous to long-range fields in more conventional theories. The reason that there must be a relation between the two strange facts we have cited is that in the presence of space-time gravity, conserved currents of high spin do not give rise to conserved charges unless they couple to long-range fields. For a high spin current, say a stress tensor T" or a higher spin current Q"', a covariant conservation law DzT"'=0 or D„Q"'=0 in curved space-time will not lead to the existence of a conserved quantity, unless the current couples to a longrange field (in which case, as in our above computation of the ADM mass of the black hole, the conserved quantity is determined by the asymptotic behavior of the longrange field and is then exactly conserved even by the Hawking process). In the c = 1, D =2 model, the candidate long-range fields are the discrete topological modes, and (apart perhaps from the fermion number, which is associated with a spin-1 current f+g+) whatever quantum numbers of the fermions are exactly conserved in the model must couple to them. 	
6	1990	Colored Black Holes	Piotr Bizon	Colored Black Holes We analyze the static spherically symmetric Einstein-Yang-Mills equations with SU(2) gauge group and show numerically that the equations possess asymptotically Aat solutions with regular event horizon and nontrivial Yang-Mills (YM) connection. The solutions have zero global YM charges and asymptotically approximate the Schwarzschild solution with quantized values of the Arnowitt-Deser-Misner mass. Our result questions the validity of the "no-hair" conjecture for YM black holes. This work cornplements the recent study of Bartnik and McKinnon on static spherically symmetric Einstein-Yang-Mills soliton solutions.  Recently, Bartnik and McKinnon have found numerically a family of soliton solutions of the Einstein-YangMills (EYM) equations with the SU(2) gauge group. ' This was rather unexpected since many facts suggested that such solutions did not exist. In particular, neither the vacuum Einstein equations nor the Yang-Mills equations have nontrivial static globally regular solutions. In this Letter we show numerically that, similarly to the globally regular case, the static SU(2) EYM equations also possess spherically symmetric black-hole solutions with nontrivial Yang-Mills (YM) connection. The existence of such black-hole solutions is quite surprising. In the previous studies of the EYM equations in the black-hole sector, the only solutions which were found had zero YM curvature. These eff'ectively Abelian solutions are given by the Kerr-Newman metric with the trivial Coulomb-type YM connection. It was even conjectured that these U(1) solutions are the only solutions of the EYM equations; i.e., black holes have no nonAbelian YM hair. Our result shows that this conjecture was false and the EYM equations have a much richer structure than the Einstein-Maxwell equations. Let us point out that our result questions the validity of the "no-hair" conjecture for YM black holes. This conjecture, well established for linear matter fields by uniqueness theorems for the Kerr-Newman black holes and nonexistence results of Bekenstein, states that the structure of a stationary black hole is completely determined by global charges defined at spatial infinity such as Arnowitt" Deser-Misner (ADM) mass, angular momentum, or electric charge. In the case of colored black holes, the global YM charges are necessarily zero, so the ADM mass remains the only global parameter describing these solutions. The existence of such black holes is incompatible with the basic idea of the no-hair conjecture, since the YM hair is not associated with any global charge which would forbid it to be radiated away to infinity. However, let Us admit that so far this does not constitute a physically serious counterexample against the no-hair conjecture because the colored black hole might be unstable and once perturbed it loses the YM  hair ending up as the Schwarzschild black hole. Our work relies extensively on Bartnik and McKinnon's study and we adopt their notation from Ref. 1. EYM equations and boundary conditions Let .u—s write a static spherically symmetric metric in the form where the functions m and 6 depend only on the Schwarzschild radius r. We want this metric to describe a nonsingular, asymptotically flat spacetime outside a regular event horizon located at r=rq. This implies the following boundary conditions: (i) Asymptotic flatness requires that as r For our purposes it is convenient to put b(rt, ) =0 [the usually used choice 8(~) =0 is connected with our choice by simple time-coordinate rescaling]. (iii) Nonexistence of singularities implies that The general spherically symmetric SU(2) connection is given by where a, b, w, and d are functions of (r, t) and (i =1,2, 3) are standard generators of su(2) Lie algebra. This form of connection is preserved by U(1) gauge transformations, where h exp[@(r,t)r31. Using this gauge freedom we can set b=—0. Now, we assume further that the connection is static; i.e., a, w, and d depend only on r. In this case the Yang-Mills equations imply that d=Cw, where C is a constant, so that we can make a further constant gauge transformation to set d—=0. Hence, the general static, spherically symmetric SU(2) connection is described by two functions w(r) and a(r). The Yang-Mills curvature F=dA+A AA is given by The EYM coupled system is described by the action where F =F,bF' . The dynamical equations derived from the action (7) are the YM equations d*F=0 and the Einstein equations G,q =8m T,b with the stressenergy tensor Before we write down the equations explicitly we shall make still one more simplification. Namely, we exclude the electric part of the YM field by imposing the 't Hooft-Polyakov Ansatz a —=0. In fact, Galtsov and Ershov have shown recently that assuming suitable asymptotic behavior the only static black-hole solution with nonzero YM electric field is the ReissnerNordstrom metric with the electric charge e and magnetic charge g: where g =0 if w = 1 or g =1 if w =—0. Let us note, however, that Galtsov and Ershov assume too restrictive falloff conditions for the electric YM field. Bartnik pointed out that, under weaker boundary conditions, there may exist nontrivial solutions with nonvanishing electric and magnetic YM fields. The existence of such dyon solutions is currently under investigation. For purely magnetic YM fields the EYM equations reduce to the system Now, let us consider what are the boundary conditions for the function w(r). The requirement that the local energy density ) be bounded at r =rb puts no extra condition on w. We shall assume that w is C' at r=rI, . Asymptotic flatness requires that the total energy outside the event horizon is finite, which means that w const as r ~. Assuming that w is constant at infinity we can solve Eq. (10) asymptotically to get For completeness let us note that Eqs. (10)-(12) also possess the trivial solution w=o with m=M —1/2r and 8=const which corresponds to the Reissner-Nordstrom metric with magnetic charge g=l. It follows from (6) and (15) that asymptotically F»-r ', and so the YM magnetic charge vanishes. Consequently, a solution for which ~ w ~ =1 at infinity is characterized by only one global parameter: the ADM mass. Thus according to the no-hair conjecture the only solution should be the Schwarzschild solution which corresponds to ~ w ~ =1, M=const. We put much eA'ort into trying to prove this uniqueness but failed. Then, encouraged by Bartnik and McKinnon's results, we tried numerical computations and to our surprise we found the essentially non-Abelian solutions. Numerical solutions Let u.s—make some a priori observations about the global behavior of solutions. From (10) it follows that if w reaches a local extremum at some radius r then at this point  Hence w cannot have local maxima for w & 1 and local minima for w & —1. From (10) we also have Since ~ w(~) ~ =1, it follows from (17) that ~ w ~ (1. It is easy to show that either ( w [ & 1 or ( w ( —= 1. Now, using (11) and (12), we replace Eq. (10) byWe numerically solve Eqs. (10a), (11), and (12) with the boundary conditions (2), (3), and (15) using the standard shooting method of solving two-point boundary-value problems. For a given value rp, we need four initial values: 6(rb ), m(rb ), w(rb ), and w'(rb). From (11)it is obvious that we can choose b'(rb) arbitrarily. We take 8(rb) =0. From (3) we have m(rb) = —rb. Finally, it follows from (loa) that w(rb) and w'(rb ) must satisfy the constraint To sum up we have only one free shooting parameter w(rb) which satisfies ~ w(rb) ~ & 1. For a fixed value ofrT, we choose some w(rT, ) and propagate it numerically trying to aim at + 1 at infinity. For example, for r~ =1, if we take w(rT, ) a bit less than 1, say w(rT, ) =0.7, then the solution diverges rapidly to —~. If we take w(rT, ) =0.6, then the solution reaches a minimum for —1 & w & 0 and then diverges to +~. It turns out that there exists a value Tv~(rT, ) 6 (0.6,0.7) such that the solution goes asymptotically to —1 [Fig. 1(a)]. In a similar way we can find solutions with a greater number of zeros, which, after oscillating in a region I w I (I, tend asymptotically to + 1. Thus, for a given value of r~ we get a discrete family of asymptotically flat solutions, labeled by n, the number of nodes of Tv. This structure is very similar to that found by Bartnik and McKinnon for globally regular solutions. However, notice that, in contrast to the regular case, we do not have a natural starting value rp. Since EYM equations do not have the scaling symmetry (remember that we have fixed the scale by putting the YM coupling constant A, =l), a priori we should treat rg as the second shooting parameter. Luckily enough, it turns out that for every value of rp we get asimilar discrete family of solutions. The initial value w(rT, ) changes continuously with rT„ indicating that probably there exists a hidden symmetry which allows us to transform solutions with diferent values of ~q one into another. The behavior of solutions for rg =1 is shown in Fig. 1. Near the event horizon the solutions are very close to the Reissner-Nordstrom solution. To show this we define after Ref. 1 the eff'ective magnetic charge g (r) by e ~ (1 —2m/r) = I —2M/r+g /r Figure 1 shows that just outside the horizon g (r) =1. Further from the horizon we have a transition zone; the magnetic charge slowly decays. When w reaches its asymptotic value ~ 1, the charge drops to zero and the solution approximates the Schwarzschild solution with mass M„. Discussion. —We realize of course that the above numerical construction gives only a strong evidence for the existence of solutions. The analytical proof of existence is obviously needed. Here, insight provided by numericalsolutions should be helpful. In particular, nontrivial information about the solutions is probably hidden behind some striking numerical coincidences. For example, we do not understand why the ratio w„(rt, )/w„+ ~(rs) is almost constant for every n. There are two additional questions that are relevant to whether the above solution is physical or not. The first question is concerned with the fact that the Schwarzschild coordinates we have used are pathological at the horizon. Thus it may happen that the smooth solution in r, t coordinates corresponds to one which in well behaved coordinates has singularities. To show that this does not happen for our solution we have checked the behavior of metric functions and the YM field in Kruskal-like coordinates and found that they are regular everywhere. Another important problem is the question of stability. It is clear from the above construction that although locally our solutions depend continuously on initial data at r =rz, they are not globally stable against a small change of initial data. In other words, the Cauchy problem (evolution in r with initial data at r =rt, ) for our equations has the global solution only for a discrete set of initial data. From the mathematical point of view, this instability is nothing strange; in fact, it is quite typical for elliptic eigenvalue problems. However, physically this suggests that a balance between the attractive gravitational force and the repulsive YM force is very fragile and may be unstable in time. In particular, the solutions found by Bartnik and McKinnon are not stable undersmall time-dependent perturbations. ' %e hope that the presence of the horizon can stabilize the solutions. We are currently working on this problem. The preliminary analysis shows that for small time-dependent perturbations there are no exponentially growing radial modes with the correct behavior at the horizon. There is an exciting possibility that the static colored black hole, if it turns out to be stable, is the final state of the collapsed Bartnik-McKinnon soliton star. In conclusion, let us remark that colored black holes may have interesting astrophysical applications but we would not like to speculate about it before the question of stability is settled positively. I would like to thank Robert	We analyze the static spherically symmetric Einstein-Yang-Mills equations with SU(2) gauge group and show numerically that the equations possess asymptotically Aat solutions with regular event horizon and nontrivial Yang-Mills (YM) connection.

7	2019	Quantum Corrected Black Holes from String T-Duality	Piero Nicolini,Euro Spallucci,and Michael F. Wondrak	Quantum Corrected Black Holes from String T-Duality In this letter we present some stringy corrections to black hole spacetimes emerging from string Tduality. As a first step, we derive the static Newtonian potential by exploiting the relation between the T-duality and the path integral duality. We show that the intrinsic non-perturbative nature of stringy corrections introduce an ultraviolet cutoff known as zero-point length in the path integral duality literature. As a result, the static potential is found to be regular. We use this result to derive a consistent black hole metric for the spherically symmetric, electrically neutral case. It turns out that the new spacetime is regular and is formally equivalent to the Bardeen metric, apart from a different ultraviolet regulator. On the thermodynamics side, the Hawking temperature admits a maximum before a cooling down phase towards a thermodynamically stable end of the black hole evaporation process. The findings support the idea of universality of quantum black holes. I. INTRODUCTION. General relativity (GR) is in excellent agreement with astronomical observations and experimental findings and has passed several high-precision tests [1]. There is, however, a fundamental problem: the classical description of the gravitational field breaks down at short scales. Curvature singularities plague GR and attempts to amend it by the formulation of a quantum theory of gravity have not been completely satisfactory so far. In particular it is still missing a derivation of a singularity free black hole or a cosmological spacetime from the first principles of a theory of quantum gravity. Given this background, there have been attempts to amend the bad short distance behavior of black hole solutions by assuming, as a guiding principle, the boundedness of spacetime curvature. Being the gravitational coupling GN = lP 2 in natural units, the curvature cannot exceed lP −2 , where lP is the Planck length. Probably the first example of regular black hole is the Bardeen spacetime [2]. By assuming a non-linear electrodynamics Lagrangian, the ultraviolet cut off is obtained in terms of the magnetic charge of the black hole itself [3]. This work has been followed by further singularity free models based on non-linear electrodynamics [4, 5]. Magnetic monopoles are, however, not yet observed in nature. Furthermore, the electric charge is quickly shed via Hawking emission and Schwinger pair production mechanism [6– 8]. To overcome such a limitation, neutral black hole models with a regular central core have been proposed in ∗ nicolini@fias.uni-frankfurt.de † spallucci@ts.infn.it ‡ wondrak@fias.uni-frankfurt.de the literature, by a process of “black hole engineering”, i.e. by assuming a limiting curvature without a derivation from first principles of a given theory [9–14] (for a review see [15] and the references therein). A major breakthrough has been achieved with a family of regular black holes that have been derived in a string-inspired way by averaging noncommutative coordinates on suitable coherent states [16–18]. Apart from the singularity freedom, such black holes offer an intriguing scenario for the end stage of the evaporation. Rather than a divergent Hawking emission, one finds a SCRAM phase, namely a cooling down towards a zero temperature extremal configuration, even in the absence of charge and angular momentum [19]. Interestingly, noncommutative effects have later been found to be equivalent to a non-local deformation of the Einstein-Hilbert action [20, 21]. This fact has propelled the recent interest about black hole solutions in non-local gravity [22–26]. Further string-based solutions can be found for instance in [27– 29]. In this letter we aim to do a further step forward. We propose to exploit the ultraviolet finiteness of string theory to tame the singularity of classical black holes. To reach the goal, we consider, as a key ingredient, the concept of T-duality. The latter identifies string theories on higher-dimensional spacetimes with mutually inverse compactification radii R. Quantum numbers are transformed correspondingly. In the case of one compact dimension, the replacement rules are R → R?2 /R and n ↔ w, where R? = √ α0 denotes the self-dual radius, α 0 is the Regge slope, n stands for the Kaluza-Klein excitation and w for the winding number of the closed string mode. Interestingly, a similar duality is enjoyed also by fields when they probe the quantum fluctuations of the background spacetime [30–32]. Normally, when calculating a field propagator in the Schwinger representation, the larger is the weight given to a path, the shorter is the length of the path itself. Shorter paths are more strongly affected by spacetime fluctuations and are expected to be suppressed in the path integral. The largest weight should be given to “mid-sized paths” of length comparable with a fundamental length scale L ∼ lP. This suggests a duality invariance of the path integral that is realized by assigning the weight exp −m  s + L 2/s, namely equal weight to paths of proper time s and those of proper time L 2/s. The final quantum-corrected propagator is regular. It shows an ultraviolet cutoff, the socalled zero-point length l0, which is assumed to equal 2L [31]. Excitingly, it is possible to embed the idea of the path integral duality into the framework of string T-duality. In the context of bosonic string theory, one can consider closed strings in a (3 + 1) + 1-dimensional spacetime [33– 35]. In order to make contact with the Schwinger proper time formalism, one has to focus on the string centerof-mass and derive its propagator in an effective 3 + 1- dimensional spacetime. The path-integral dual propagator arises from the T-dual propagator when expanded to first order. This allows for a crystalline identification of parameters between the T-dual string theory and the path integral dual field theory, namely the zero-point length turns out to be equal to l0 = 2πR? = 2π √ α0 . The ultraviolet finiteness of both the above string/field formulations provides a road map to derive regular black hole solutions. We start by deriving the quantum-corrected static interaction potential according to the field theory enjoying the path integral duality. We focus on the case of a scalar interaction as only the kinetic modification, but not the tensor structure, is relevant. As an important background result, we recall that the momentum space propagator induced by the path integral duality is given, in the massless case,  ) induced by the path integral duality or, equivalently, by T-duality. To our best knowledge, this is a new result which has not been derived in previous literature. In contrast to the ordinary 1/r-divergence, quantum spacetime fluctuations naturally implement a short-distance cutoff which acts non-perturbatively. II. T-DUALITY BLACK HOLE. The above result for the potential can be interpreted as a smearing effect of the matter distribution in contrast to conventional pointlike sources. The energy density of the modified matter follows from the Poisson equati 5) This fact opens the route to consistently study the quantum modifications of the spacetime geometry. Much in the same way as for the Poisson equation, one can obtain quantum corrections of the Einstein tensor by coupling gravity to a quantum corrected energy momentum tensor Tµν [16, 20]. The general solution in case of a static, spherically symmetric source r 7) and m(r) = 4π R r 0 d¯r r¯ 2 ρ(¯r). The Schwarzschild geometry corresponds to the case of a pointlike source, namely ρ(~x) = Mδ(~x). Accordingly, the energy density, ρ(r) in (5), corresponds to the component T0 0 of the quantum-modified energy-momentum tensor in static coordinates. Spherical symmetry leads to the following form in Schwarzschild-like coordinates: (Tµ ν ) = diag (−ρ, pr, pt, pt). Here, pr and pt are the radial and transverse pressures, respectively. From energymomentum conservation, ∇µT µν = 0, and from the condition grr = −g −1 00 as in the Schwarzschild solution, the pressures are uniquely fixed in terms of the energy density. The only free metric degree of freedom is parametrized by the mass function m(r) that after integration leads to the following metric coeffic with M the Komar mass (see Fig. 1). The first surprising feature of the above spacetime geometry is that it is equivalent to the Bardeen black hole after changing the ultraviolet cutoff, namely by replacing the magnetic charge with l0. This means that the spacetime is regular! Stringy effects produce a de Sitter core at the origin, i.e. g00 ' −1 + Λeff r 2/3 for r  l0, with an effective cosmological constant Λeff = 6M/l0 3 . This repulsive effect on small distances stabilizes the matter configuration against collapse. We will refer to (8) as the “T-duality black hole”. The limit l0 → 0 provides a cross check for consistency of our calculations. Throughout the letter, the ordinary GR results are recovered. Furthermore, the (infinite) series expansion in eq. (8) demonstrates that l0 appears in a non-perturbative way. It is only due to such a nonperturbative nature of the quantum corrections that the central singularity in the Schwarzschild case is tamed. Another novelty of the solution is its mirror symmetry. Being the spacetime regular, it is geodesically complete. However in contrast to regular black holes obtained in the context of noncommutative geometry [16], the transformation r → −r does not generate negative mass solutions but a replica of the same universe [36]. Only the transformation M → −|M| generates another universe, i.e. a regular soliton of negative mass. We recall that regions of negative energy density might occur in the early universe for the quantum fluctuation at short scales [37, 38]. As a result, both positive and negative mass solutions should be considered as legitimate instantons and are expected to modify the standard scenario of de Sitter space decay [39, 40]. The positive real roots of the metric component g00 correspond to the horizon positions relative to the mass distribution. For M > 3 √ 3 4 l0 there exist two roots, the inner and outer horizon, r− and r+, respectively. For large black hole masses M, the outer (event) horizon r+ up to a 1/M correction that resembles the 1/N quantum hair of the black hole quantum N portrait [41–43] as well as what was recently found in the context of the generalized uncertainty principle [44]. On the other hand, in such a limit, the inner horizon approaches the origin For M = Mextr ≡ 3 √ 3 4 l0 ≈ 1.30 l0 there exists an extremal configuration with horizon radius r− = r+ = r extr = √ 2 l0 ≈ 1.41 l0. For smaller values of M, there is no root of g00 and the geometry is a horizonless regular spacetime. The extremal configuration is of particular interest because it corresponds to a thermodynamically stable remnant configuration as will be shown below. More importantly, the extremal configuration plays a fundamental role in the so called gravity self-completeness paradigm [8, 45–48]. Normally in particle collisions matter is compressed to length scales of the order of the Compton wavelength λC. However, if a particle is accelerated to an energy larger than Mextr, it is compressed below its corresponding horizon. This means that the particle undergoes a gravitational collapse into a black hole. In such a context the extremal configuration, being the smallest size black hole, is the natural candidate for the particle-black hole configuration. The latter separates the two possible phases of matter, the particle sector (M < Mextr) and the black hole sector (M > Mextr). From the condition r extr != λC(Mextr), we directly obtain: Eq. (11) determines the value of the zero-point length. In the context of the path integral duality, we confirm l0 ∼ lP as originally assumed in [30]. Moreover, we can also provide the Regge slope with a physical value, III. BLACK HOLE THERMODYNAMICS. From (8) the Hawking temperature of the black hole reads and is presented in Fig. 2. It has a maximum at r q crit = 7+√ 57 2 l0. The black hole entropy, S, is obtained by integrating the first law of black hole thermodynamics in the form dM = T dS with the boundary condition S(r extr) = 0: Equation (16) explicitly demonstrate that the entropy is finite confirming the conjecture in [31]. In general, T-duality black holes correctly reproduce the thermodynamic properties of the corresponding GR solution, i.e. Schwarzschild, for large distances, r/l0  1. For small distances, we find peculiar deviations. First of all, there are black holes for all values of r+ in the case of Schwarzschild while only above the threshold r extr for the T-dual metric. It is interesting to note that (16) has been obtain by an analytic integration of the first law of thermodynamics. Furthermore (16) is consistent with the area l  The presence of an effective gravitational coupling is a feature present also in other models (see for instance [54]). For horizon radii in the range r extr ≤ r+ ≤ r crit, the temperature of the T-dual spacetime increases with the horizon size and hence with the mass (cf. Fig. 2). This implies a positive heat capacity and thermodynamical stability. At r crit, the existence of a divergence of the heat capacity indicates a first-order phase transition between the phase of positive and that of negative heat capacity. In the context of Hawking evaporation, a black hole of size smaller than r crit deviates from the Schwarzschild behavior. Instead of getting increasingly hotter with a final explosion, it cools down (SCRAM phase [18]). The extremal configuration carries a significant role: It is of vanishing temperature and of vanishing entropy. Thus it can be regarded as a thermodynamically stable remnant of the black hole evaporation process. The properties discussed above are similar for other quantum-corrected black hole models, cf. e.g. [16, 18, 21, 23, 26, 55–60]. Therefore, the T-duality black hole promotes the notion of universal black hole characteristics in the quantum regime. IV. CONCLUSIONS AND OUTLOOK. Despite string theory is a candidate for the quantum completion of gravity, there is yet no stringy descripti for black holes at full quantum level. In the presence of supersymmetry, D-branes show similar properties to classical black holes [27, 61]. In the context of the AdS/CFT correspondence, there are hints towards a microscopic explanation of the semiclassical Bekenstein entropy [62]. The problem of the curvature singularity, however, is not solved. In contrast, the fuzzball concept is an exotic proposal which replaces the ordinary black hole by a condensed string state [28]. Avoiding a singularity at the center only works at the expense of sacrificing the very concept of an event horizon. Indeed, there is no classical limit in which one recovers the ordinary GR description. The present letter contributes to fill this gap in the literature. We showed that it is possible to extract relevant string corrections to the classical description. We believe that our solution is opening a new route in quantum gravity, black holes and string theory that deserves 	In this letter we present some stringy corrections to black hole spacetimes emerging from string Tduality. As a first step, we derive the static Newtonian potential by exploiting the relation between the T-duality and the path integral duality. We show that the intrinsic non-perturbative nature of stringy corrections introduce an ultraviolet cutoff known as zero-point length in the path integral duality literature. As a result, the static potential is found to be regular. We use this result to derive a consistent black hole metric for the spherically symmetric, electrically neutral case. It turns out that the new spacetime is regular and is formally equivalent to the Bardeen metric, apart from a different ultraviolet regulator. On the thermodynamics side, the Hawking temperature admits a maximum before a cooling down phase towards a thermodynamically stable end of the black hole evaporation process. The findings support the idea of universality of quantum black holes. 
8	1991	Two-Dimensional Charged Black Holes in String Theory	Nobuyuki Ishibashi, "' Miao Li, and Alan R. Steif '	Two-Dimensional Charged Black Holes in String Theory Recently, exact solutions to string theory in the form of two-dimensional black holes were found [1-4]. It would be interesting to generalize this result to charged black holes. Previously [5], solutions to the low-order effective action in the form of four-dimensional charged black holes were shown to exist. In this paper, we construct a two-dimensional charged black hole as an exact conformal field theory. The original two-dimensional black hole was constructed by gauging a U(1) subgroup of an SL(2,R) Wess-Zumino-Witten (WZW) model. The electrically charged black hole discussed here is obtained by adding a boson to the model and coupling it to the world-sheet gauge field. After integrating out the worldsheet gauge field, we obtain a solution for the spacetime metric, dilaton, and electromagnetic field which describes a charged black hole. The charge of the black hole is where e is the coupling between the world-sheet gauge field and the free-boson field, k is the level of the WZW model, and a is an undetermined constant which appears in the dilation background. The mass of the black hole is the same as that of the uncharged black hole: Unlike the Reissner-Nordstrom solution, the singularity is hidden behind a horizon for arbitrary large values of the electric charge. It is also possible to construct other conformal field theories which describe solutions with naked singularities as well as solutions with no singularities at all. To obtain closed-string theories which have gauge fields in their massless spectrum, one introduces free bosons or, equivalently, free fermions on the world sheet [6]. For example, a bosonic string model with gauge fields can be obtained by starting from a system of bosons, X", describing the embedding of the world sheet in spacetime, together with free bosons, X, which are compactified so as to realize the Kac-Moody current of the gauge group. Normally, in the heterotic string one considers chiral bosons, but here we will include both left and right movers. This will then yield a separate gauge symmetry for both the left and right currents. Such a string model in a gravitational, gauge field, and dilation background (G„„A„',At, p) is described by a nonlinear sigma modelHere, we have assumed that the gauge background takes values only in the Cartan subalgebra of the gauge group. In order to obtain a conformal field theory which describes a charged black hole, we start from an SL(2,R) WZW model with a free compact boson: in the SL(2,R) WZW action. We also wish to couple the gauge field to the compact boson. The free-boson system has chiral U(1) currents BX and |1X, which are essential to the gauge symmetry of the string theory. There are two ways to couple the gauge fields to these currents. First, we can gauge the U(1) translation symmetry generated by these currents: Since the left and right U(1) currents satisfy the U(1) Kac-Moody algebra independently, we can also couple the gauge fields to the U(1) currents in the following way: & 1 and a black hole with an imaginary gauge field for e /2k & 1. The second scheme (4), as we now show, leads to a black hole with a real gauge field for all values of e. Using (4) we have the following two-dimensional action: Since 8X and BXsatisfy the U(1) Kac-Moody algebra, the gauge action above is exactly solvable as in the usual gauged WZW models [8]. Since the compact boson has central charge c =1 and the gauging reduces c by 1, the central charge of this conformal field theory is just that of the WZW model: where p=lncosh r+const. Comparing with Eq. (1), it is easy to see that this two-dimensional action describes a This yields the spacetime metric, two-dimensional string theory in a nontrivial gravitational, gauge field, and dilaton background. There is also a scalar field associated with the vertex operator: The dilaton field arises from the integration measure and can be checked to one loop in sigma-model perturbation theory. It should be noted that the procedure described above is also applicable when we use fermions instead of bosons to incorporate the gauge fields or even when we have chiral fermions as would occur in the heterotic string. We note that A„=A„ in the case at hand. We can generalize our construction to the case A„&A„by gauging the left and right U(l) independently in the WZW sector. For example, we can gauge only the symmetry generated by 8X in the boson system together with a suitable modification of (2), which balances the left and right anomalies. In this case we would obtain a string theory with only an A„background and no extra scalar background. This results in either a naked singularity or a black hole with an imaginary gauge field. To obtain a Lorentzian signature black hole we could gauge a noncompact U(1) subgroup. Here, we merely analytically continue to Lorentzian signature by O it where a is a constant. In addition, we have a scalar background associated with the compact boson. This solution describes a charged black hole with a metric and dilaton which are identical to that of the uncharged black hole [1]. It should be observed that if we think of the solution as a three-dimensional metric, then shifting t by a multiple of L diagonalizes the metric and yields the product of the uncharged black hole and a circle. Hence, one might think that the charged black hole is equivalent to the uncharged black hole. However, this is not the case. Since X is compact, the new coordinates which one obtains by such a coordinate transformation are not good global coordinates on the cylinder. Moreover, it can be shown that the two underlying conformal field theories are inequivalent. We now calculate the mass and charge of the black hole. The mass of the black hole can be obtained by the Arnowitt-Deser-Misner procedure. The low-energy effective action for the background fields is quadratic in the electromagnetic field strength and in gradients of the scalar field. Since both of these vanish asymptotically, the gauge field and the scalar field will not contribute to the mass. Thus, the mass is the same as that of the uncharged black hole We can also find the electric charge of the black hole. The equation of motion for the gauge field can be obtained by dimensionally reducing to two dimensions the low-energy three-dimensional eAective action. Far from the singularity, the equation of motion takes the form where F =e~e„,F"'. In four dimensions, F would become a two-form, and the charge would be the integral of F over a two-sphere. In two dimensions since F is a scalar, we merely evaluate it at ~. One should note that the equation of motion insures that Q is independent of r. Evaluating Eq. (9), we obtain We also note that one should include in the solution quantum corrections coming from the determinant which arise in the Gaussian integration over the gauge field. Asymptotically, the sole eAect of this is to replace k by k —2. It should be noted that unlike the uncharged black hole, there will now be an infinite tower of propagating massive states. In addition, there will be an instability due to the tachyon. As in the case of the uncharged black hole, we expect that there exists a superconformal version of the charged black hole. In this case, there would be no tachyon, and the theory would be stable. Finally, we should point out that by constructions similar to that described in this paper it is also possible to obtain black string solutions [9].

9	2005	Black Hole Entropy Function and the Attractor Mechanism in Higher Derivative Gravity	Ashoke Sen	Black Hole Entropy Function and the Attractor Mechanism in Higher Derivative Gravity Abstract We study extremal black hole solutions in D dimensions with near horizon geometry AdS2 × SD−2 in higher derivative gravity coupled to other scalar, vector and antisymmetric tensor fields. We define an entropy function by integrating the Lagrangian density over  2 background, taking the Legendre transform of the resulting function with respect to the parameters labelling the electric fields, and multiplying the result by a factor of 2 π. We show that the values of the scalar fields at the horizon as well as the sizes of AdS  2 are determined by extremizing this entropy function with respect to the corresponding parameters, and the entropy of the black hole is given by the value of the entropy function at this extremum. Our analysis relies on the analysis of the equations of motion and does not directly make use of supersymmetry or specific structure of the higher derivative terms. 1 Introduction and Summary Analysis of supersymmetric black holes in string theory have led to many new insights into the classical and quantum aspects of black holes. In particular a rich structure has emerged in the context of half-BPS black holes in N = 2 supersymmetric string theories in four dimensions. One of the important features of these black holes is the attractor mechanism [1, 2, 3] by which the values of the scalar fields at the horizon are determined only by the charges carried by the black hole and are independent of the asymptotic values of the scalar fields. The entropy of these black holes agrees with the microscopic counting of the states of the brane system they describe, not only in the supergravity approximation, but also after the inclusion of higher derivative corrections to the generalized prepotential[4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14]. More recently it has been shown that the Legendre transform of the black hole entropy with respect to the electric charges is directly related to the generalized prepotential, and this has led to a new conjectured relation between the black hole entropy and topological string partition function[15, 16, 17, 18]. Finally, applying the results for these black holes to the special case of black holes in heterotic string theory with purely electric charges, one finds agreement between black hole entropy and the degeneracy of elementary string states[19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27] even though the black hole entropy vanishes in the supergravity approximation[28, 29, 30]. All of these results have been derived by making heavy use of supersymmetry. In particular while taking into account the effect of higher derivative terms one includes in the string theory effective action only a special class of terms which can be computed using the partition function of topological string theory[31, 32, 33]. These corrections are controlled by a special function known as the generalized prepotential[8, 12, 13]. While these constitute an important set of terms in the string theory effective acion, they are 2 by no means the only terms, and at present there is no understanding of why these terms should play a special role in the study of black holes. In fact there are counterexamples, involving elementary string states in type II string theory, for which the corrections to the generalized prepotential are not enough to produce the desired result for the black hole entropy[24]. Thus it seems important to study the role of the complete set of higher derivative terms on the near horizon geometry of the black hole. In this paper we study the effect of higher derivative terms on the entropy of extremal black holes in D dimensions following the general formalism developed in [34, 35, 36, 37]. We do not make use of supersymmetry directly, but define extremal black holes to be those objects whose near horizon geometry is given by AdS2×S D−2 . 1 We also define the entropy of the extremal black hole to be the extremal limit of the entropy of a non-extremal black hole so that we can use the general formula for the entropy given in [34, 35, 36, 37] even though strictly extremal black holes do not have a bifurcate horizon. Our main results may be summarized as follows. 1. Let SBH(~q, ~p) denote the entropy of a D-dimensional extremal black hole, with near horizon geometry AdS2 × S D−2 , as a function of electric charges {qi} associated with one form gauge fields and magnetic charges {pa} associated with (D − 3) form gauge fields. We choose a coordinate system in which the AdS2 part of the metric is proportional to −r 2dt2 + dr2 /r2 . Then the Legendre transform of SBH (~q, ~p)/2π with respect to the variables qi is equal to the the integral of the Lagrangian density over the (D − 2) dimensional sphere S D−2 enclosing the black hole. The variable conjugate to qi represents the radial electric field ei at the horizon associated with the i-th gauge field. 2. Consider a general AdS2 ×S D−2 background parametrized by the sizes of AdS2 and S D−2 , the electric and magnetic fields and the values of various scalar fields. We define an entropy function by integrating the Lagrangian density evaluated for this background over S D−2 , taking the Legendre transform of this integral with respect to the parameters ei labelling the electric fields and multiplying the result by 2π. The result is a function of the values us of the scalar fields, the sizes v1 and v2 of AdS2 and S D−2 , the electric charges qi conjugate to the variables ei , and the magnetic charges pa labelling the background magnetic fields. We show that for given ~q and ~p, the values us of the scalar fields as well as the sizes v1 and v2 of AdS2 and S D−2 are determined by extremizing the entropy function with respect to the variables ui , v1 and v2. Furthermore the entropy itself is given by the value of the entropy function at the horizon. 3. For extremal black hole solutions without Ramond-Ramond (RR) charges in tree level string theory the Lagrangian density at the horizon vanishes due to the dilaton field equation. In this case the entropy of the black hole is given simply by 2π times the product of the electric field at the horizon and the electric charge of the black hole. These results rely on the assumption that the Lagrangian density can be expressed in terms of gauge invariant field strengths and does not involve the gauge fields explicitly. Thus if Chern-Simons terms are present we either need to remove them by going to the dual field variables, or if that is not possible, consider black hole solutions which are not affected by these Chern-Simons terms. 2 Entropy of Extremal Black Holes We begin by considering a four dimensional theory of gravity coupled to a set of abelian gauge fields A(i) µ and neutral scalar fields {φs}. Suppose √ − det g L is the lagrangian density, expressed as a function of the metric gµν, the scalar fields {φs}, the gauge field strengths F (i) µν , and covariant derivatives of these fields. We consider a spherically symmetric extremal black hole solution with near horizon geometry AdS2 × S 2 . The most general field configuration, consistent with the SO(2, 1)×SO(3) symmetry of AdS2 ×S 2 , is of the form: where v1, v2, {us}, {ei} and {pi} are constants. For this background the nonvanishing components of the Riemann tensor are:2It follows from the general form of the background that the covariant derivatives of the scalar fields φs, the gauge field strengths F (i) µν and the Riemann tensor Rµνρσ all vanish for the near horizon geometry. By the general symmetry consideration it follows that the contribution to the equation of motion from any term in the action that involves covariant derivatives of the gauge field strengths, scalars or the Riemann tensor vanish identically for this background and we can restrict our attention to only those terms which do not involve covariant derivatives of these fields.3 Let us denote by f(~u, ~v, ~e, ~p) the Lagrangian density √ − det g L evaluated for the near horizon geometry (2.1) and integrated over the angular coordinates[27]: The scalar and the metric field equations in the near horizon geometry correspond to extremizing f with respect to the variables ~u and ~v: On the other hand the non-trivial components of the gauge field equations and the Bianchi identities take the form: the black hole. From this it follows that the constants pi appearing in (2.1) correspond to magnetic charges of the black hole, and where qi denote the electric charges carried by the black hole. For fixed ~p and ~q, (2.4) and (2.6) give a set of equations which are equal in number to the number of unknowns ~u, ~v and ~e. In a generic case we may be able to solve these equations completely to determine the background in terms of only the electric and the magnetic charges ~q and ~p. 4 This is consistent with the attractor mechanism for supersymmetric background which says that the near horizon configuration of a black hole depends only on the electric and magnetic charges carried by the black hole and not on the asymptotic values of these scalar fields. We shall return to a more detailed discussion of this mechanism in section 3. Let us now turn to the analysis of the entropy associated with this black hole. A general formula for the entropy in the presence of higher derivative terms has been given in [34, 35, 36, 37]. The formula simplifies enormously here since the covariant derivatives of all the tensors vanish, and we get a simple formula:  where AH is the area of the event horizon and ∂L ∂Rµνρσ is defined through the equation In computing δL we can ignore all terms in L which involve covariant derivatives of the Riemann tensor, and treat the components of the Riemann tensor as independent variables. In order to simplify this formula let us denote by fλ(~u, ~v, ~e, ~p) an expression similar to the right hand side of (2.3) except that each factor of Rrtrt in the expression of L is We shall now reexpress the right hand side of (2.12) in terms of derivatives of f with respect to the variables ~u, ~v, ~e and ~p. Since the expression for L is invariant under reparametrization of the r, t coordinates, every factor of Rrtrt in the expression for fλ must appear in the combination λ grrg ttRrtrt = −λv−1 1 , every factor of F (i) rt must appear in the combination √ −g rrg ttF (i) rt = eiv −1 1 , and every factor of F (i) θφ = ei and φs = us must appear without any accompanying power of v1. The contribution from all terms which involve covariant derivatives of F (i) µν , Rµνρσ or φs vanish; hence there is no further factor of v1 coming from contraction of the metric with these derivative operators. The only other v1 dependence of fλ(~u, ~v, ~e, ~p) is through the overall multiplicative factor of √ − det g ∝ v1. Thus fλ(~u, ~v, ~e, ~p) must be of the form v1g(~u, v2, ~p, λv−1 1 , ~ev−1 1 ) for some function g, and we have  This together with (2.6) shows that SBH (~q, ~p)/2π may be regarded as the Legendre transform of the function f(~u, ~v, ~e, ~p) with respect to the variables ei after eliminating ~u and ~v through their equations of motion (2.4). The analysis can be easily generalized to higher dimensional theories as follows. In D space-time dimensions we consider an extremal black hole solution with near horizon geometry AdS2 × S D−2 . The relevant fields which can take non-trivial expectation value near the horizon are scalars {φs}, metric gµν, gauge fields A(i) µ and (D − 3)-form gauge fields B(a) µ1...µD−3 . If H(a) µ1...µD−2 denote the field strength associated with the B field, then the general background consistent with the SO(2, 1)×SO(D−1) symmetry of the background geometry is of the form: where dΩD−2 = h (D−2) ll′ dxldxl ′ denotes the line element on the unit (D − 2)-sphere, ΩD−2 denotes the area of the unit (D − 2)-sphere, x li with 2 ≤ li ≤ (D − 1) are coordinates along this sphere and ǫ denotes the totally anti-symmetric symbol with ǫ2...(D−1) = 1. We now define as in (2.3). Analysis identical to that for D = 4 now tells us that the constants pa represent magnetic type charges carried by the black hole, and the equations which determine the values of ~u, ~v and ~e are where qi denote the electric charges carried by the black hole. Also using (2.7) which is valid in any dimension, we can show that the entropy of the black hole is given by 2π times the Legendre transform of f:  At string tree level, and in the absence of Ramond-Ramond background fields (which includes all black holes in heterotic string theory) the Lagrangian density at the horizon and hence the function f vanishes due to the dilaton field equation. Thus eqs.(2.17), (2.18) give: SBH = 2π qi ei . (2.19) In other words the entropy of these black holes is given by 2π times the product of the electric charge and the electric field at the horizon. It will be interesting to see if this quantity admits a simple interpretation in the world-sheet conformal field theory that describes this background. 3 Attractor Mechanism and the Entropy Function We can now reformulate the attractor mechanism in a more suggestive manner. Let us define In that case it follows from (2.17) that the values of ~u and ~v at the horizon are determined by extremizing the function F(~u, ~v, ~q, ~p) with respect to ~u and ~v:  Furthermore, eq.(2.18) shows that the black hole entropy SBH is given by the value of the function F at this extremum:  with ~u, ~v given by eq.(3.3). This suggests that we call F(~u, ~v, ~q, ~p) the entropy function. Finally, the near horizon electric field ei are given by 4 Relation to Earlier Results We are now in a position to discuss the relation between our results and the observation of [15] that the Legendre transform of the entropy of a black hole in N = 2 supersymmetric string theory is given by the imaginary part of the generalized prepotential of the theory. In the argument of the prepotential the real parts of the complex vector multiplet scalar fields are replaced, up to a constant of proportionality, by the magnetic charges of the black hole, whereas the imaginary parts of these scalar fields are replaced by the variables conjugate to the electric charges of the black hole. This result follows from our results together with the following observations (see e.g. [12]): 1. For the near horizon configuration of the black hole in N = 2 supersymmetric string theory, all terms in the Lagrangian density vanish, except for a single term proportional to the imaginary part of the generalized prepotential . 2. For the near horizon geometry the real parts of the vector multiplet scalar fields are proportional to the magnetic field at the horizon whereas the imaginary parts of these scalar fields are proportional to the electric field at the horizon. A little algebra shows that all the normalization factors also work out correctly and we can reproduce the abovementioned observation of [15] from our results 	Abstract We study extremal black hole solutions in D dimensions with near horizon geometry AdS2 × SD−2 in higher derivative gravity coupled to other scalar, vector and antisymmetric tensor fields.

10	1995	MASSLESS BLACK HOLES AND CONIFOLDS IN STRING THEORY	Andrew Strominger	MASSLESS BLACK HOLES AND CONIFOLDS IN STRING THEORY Abstract Low-energy effective field theories arising from Calabi-Yau string compactifications are generically inconsistent or ill-defined at the classical level because of conifold singularities in the moduli space. It is shown, given a plausible assumption on the degeneracies of black hole states, that for type II theories this inconsistency can be cured by nonperturbative quantum effects: the singularities are resolved by the appearance of massless RamondRamond black holes. The Wilsonian effective action including these light black holes is smooth near the conifold, and the singularity is reproduced when they are integrated out. In order for a quantum effect to cure a classical inconsistency, it can not be suppressed by the usual string coupling gs. It is shown how the required gs dependence arises as a result of the peculiar couplings of Ramond-Ramond gauge fields to the dilaton. 1. Introduction In the last several years there has been spectacular progress in our understanding of Calabi-Yau compactifications of string theory. A fascinating and ubiquitous phenomenon, beautifully exemplified in [1], is the occurrence of conifold singularities in the moduli space of classical string vacua. These are typically real codimension two surfaces in the moduli space at which a dimension two or three submanifold of the Calabi-Yau space shrinks to zero size, and the curvature of the moduli space metric blows up. They arise in virtually every Calabi-Yau string compactification. The mathematics of these singularities is well understood [2,3,1,4,5,6], but the physics is not. Consider a time-dependent modulus field in a cosmological setting which is slowly rolling around in a generic fashion. Eventually it will run in to a conifold singularity. Low-energy effective field theory – as described by a a sigma model whose target is the moduli space – is then inadequate for continuing the evolution because the sigma model equations of motion become singular. Our current understanding of strings on Calabi-Yau spaces must therefore be regarded as seriously incomplete. There are several reasons why it is important to understand the physical behavior of string theory near conifolds. One of these is that, in our efforts to connect string theory with reality, it is important to find generic features of string compactifications which might lead to model-independent predictions. Conifold singularities are certainly one of the most significant such features. Secondly, under some weak assumptions, a generic superpotential will have local (or possibly global) minima at the conifold singularities. It is thus quite possible that the theory is driven to the conifold after supersymmetry breaking. Since this point is outside the main emphasis of the present paper its demonstration is given in a brief appendix. In this paper we endeavor to explain the physics of conifolds. Specifically we show that, in the context of a type II string1 , the breakdown of low-energy effective field theory may arise from integrating out a field which becomes massless at the singularity. The quanta of this field are extremally-charged Ramond-Ramond (RR) black holes! The conifold singularity can be resolved by including this field in the low-energy effective action. The consistency of our picture requires that there is one and only one supermultiplet which becomes massless at the singularity. Ideally one would like to derive this from a semiclassical analysis of the extremal black holes. Unfortunately the counting of black 1 The proper interpretation of conifolds for heterotic strings remains a mystery. hole states is a tricky problem, so the best we can do at present is give some plausibility arguments in section 4.2. The consistency of our overall picture is of course evidence for our assumption, but it is not ruled out that there is a completely different resolution of the conifold singularities with a different numbers of massless states. Indeed, evidence for a picture quite different than that described herein was given in [2]. At first it may seem surprising that classical black holes can become massless. However this phenomenon has an appealing explanation from a ten-dimensional perspective. The IIA (IIB) theory has extremal black twobrane (threebrane) solutions [7] whose mass is proportional their area. After Calabi-Yau compactification these may wrap around minimal two (three) surfaces and appear as four-dimensional black holes. As the area of the surfaces around which they wrap goes to zero, the corresponding black holes become massless. The structure of the low-energy effective field theory described here is very similar to that found in [8] for N = 2 Yang-Mills. This latter case involves conifold singularities which are resolved by the inclusion of massless BPS magnetic monopoles, rather than extremal black holes. A characteristic feature of both examples are monodromies which describe how the charges of a state transported around the singularity are shifted by an SP(2r; Z) transformation, where r depends on the dimension of the moduli space. A puzzling difference between the two cases is as follows. In the Yang-Mills case the form of the singularity can be derived from a one-loop computation in the light monopole effective field theory, or equivalently as an instanton effect in the original theory. In our case it is possible to derive the form of the singularity by a one-loop computation in the effective field theory with light black holes, but we do not understand the analog of the instanton computation. As discussed in section 4.3, such an instanton computation may make sense in the context of an as-yet-unknown dual formulation of string theory in which fundamental strings are solitons. It has long been speculated that black holes should be treated as elementary particles. In the present paper we argue that string theory requires this - in the sense that extremal black holes contribute to virtual quantum loops in a manner determined by their mass and charge - in order to have a consistent resolution of conifold singularities. In addition to conifold singularities, the moduli space of string vacua can also contain orbifold-like singularities at which low-energy field theory is in danger of breaking down. It has been understood for some time (see for example [9]) that such singularities can be resolved by the appearance of extra light vector bosons associated with the singularity. However for example in K3 compactification of a type II theory there are no such massless states in string perturbation theory. It was conjectured in [10,11,12,13] and verified by construction in [14] that such states exist non-perturbatively with the correct degeneracies as RR solitons. The fact that the solitons have spin one as required for a gauge boson is related to the N = 4 supersymmetry. The resolution we propose here of conifold singularities is similar in spirit. The difference in the present case is that there is only N = 2 supersymmetry, and the solitons have maximum spin one-half. They therefore produce conifold rather than orbifold singularities when they become massless. A striking feature of both the N = 4 and N = 2 cases is that consistency of the low energy theory is rescued by the intervention of nonperturbative quantum effects which are independent of the usual string coupling gs and are thus even larger than the e −1/gs effects discussed in [15]. However the nature of these effects is quite unusual and very restricted in form. We shall see in 4.1 that these large effects are possible due to the peculiarities of RR gauge fields. Related observations were made in [11]. This paper is organized as follows. Section 2 briefly reviews some relevant aspects of conifolds and special geometry. Section 3 describes the black holes and their properties. In section 4 it is explained how they resolve the conifold singularity, and we conclude in section 5. The appendix discusses the behavior of a generic superpotential near a conifold. 2. Review of Conifolds and Special Geometry This section contains a lightning review of some relevant aspects of conifolds [1] and special geometry [16,17]. More complete discussion and references can be found in [1] - [6]. A Calabi-Yau space X has b3 topologically non-trivial three-surfaces. Poincare duality implies the existence of a fixed integral basis AI , BJ I, J = 1, .. 1 2 b3 of surfaces with intersections This basis is unique up to Sp(b3; Z) transformations, under which (AI , BJ ) transforms as a vector and the intersection matrix (2.1) is preserved. A choice of complex structure on X is characterized by the b3 periods of the holomorphic three-form Ω with respect to the fixed basis (2.1). The periods Z I (or alternately FI ) can be used as projective coordinates on the moduli space M of complex structures on X. They are projective because complex rescaling of Ω does not correspond to a change in the complex structure. M is a special Kahler manifold, and the periods (2.2) are a projective section of an Sp(b3; Z) vector bundle over M [16,17]. In general M may contain a complex codimension one submanifold, at which one of the periods, say Z 1 , vanishes. When Z 1 = 0, the corresponding three-surface B1 degenerates to zero size, and the Calabi-Yau space X is a singular “conifold”. Since the surface Z 1 = 0 is complex codimension one in M, it can be encircled by a closed loop. If X is transported about this loop there is no guarantee that the basis (2.1) will return to itself. Indeed there is a typical Sp(b3; Z) monodromy while all the other periods are smooth and nonzero (for a simple degeneration). The existence of a singularity in the metric G on M follows readily from equation (2.4) and the formula for G [18]: To specify a string vacuum one must also choose a complexified Kahler class J + iB on X. This leads to b2 additional complex moduli. Mirror symmetry exchanges these with the complex structure moduli, implying a parallel description in terms of periods of the complexified Kahler form which can be found in [4]. Of course the classical moduli space is just the complexified Kahler cone and has no conifold singularities. However string theory instructs us to correct for the effects of worldsheet instantons which wrap around topologically non-trivial two-surfaces. One then finds that the periods can vanish at points where the instanton corrections are large. This corresponds to a conifold singularity at which the quantum-corrected area of a two-surface is degenerating to zero. Note that these are quantum corrections on the worldsheet only, and that no string loop effects are included in this calculation. 3. Extremal Black p-branes In this section we will argue that type II string theories compactified on a Calabi-Yau space contain black holes which become massless near a conifold. 3.1. The Type IIB Theory Ten-dimensional type IIB string theory [19] contains a self-dual five-form field strength obeying when the other antisymmetric tensor fields in the theory vanish. There is an associated conserved charge for every homology class of five-surfaces Σ5. The charge Q can be carried by a 3 + 1 dimensional extended object, or threebrane enclosed by Σ5. Extended black hole solutions carrying the charge Q are given by [7] where φ is the dilaton, R S5 ǫ5 = 1, x i , i = 7, 8, 9 is a coordinate on the threebrane, and the inner and outer horizons r± are related to Q by Q = 2r 2 +r 2 −. r+ is a regular outer horizon and there is a singularity at r−. Classically there is a solution for every value of Q, but we will assume that there is a quantization condition so that Q takes the minimal value Q = g5. At the quantum level most of these solutions are unstable due to Hawking radiation. They will decay to the extremal limit at which r+ = r− and the metric becomes Now consider compactification of the IIB theory from ten to four dimensions on a Calabi-Yau space X. The four-dimensional theory will have h21 N = 2 vector multiplets whose scalars are the coordinates Z I on M with metric G of (2.5). The extremal threebrane can then wrap around one of the three-surfaces AI , BJ in X. Such configurations will appear as ordinary localized solitons or black holes in four dimensions. Quantiztion of RR charge implies where S 2 is a spatial two-sphere surrounding the black hole. The integers mJ and nI are four-dimensional electromagnetic charges associated with the h21 vector multiplets and the graviphoton. One expects that the minimal energy configuration will saturate a BPS bound3 . Up to an overall constant the unique Kahler and Sp(b3; Z) invariant formula for the BPS mass is [12] 3.2. The Type IIA Theory The type IIA theory has a four-form RR field strength F. The associated charge is carried by twobrane solutions [7]. Calabi-Yau compactification on X′ leads to b2 vector multiplets whose scalars are again the coordinates on a special Kahler manifold M′ . The twobranes can wrap around minimal two-surfaces of M′ to produce four-dimensional extremal black holes. These black holes will then become massless at the conifold singularities of M′ where the area of the minimal surface (corrected by worldsheet instantons) degenerates. Since mirror symmetry exchanges IIB compactification on X with IIA compactification on the mirror of X [22,23], it will also exchange threebranes with twobranes. Hence if X′ is the mirror of X the analysis of the black hole solutions reduces to that considered above. While the mathematical analysis is equivalent, the physical picture is significantly different. In the IIA case the conifold singularity and the massless states are a result of large instanton corrections. This will figure in to the comparison of section 4.3 with recent quantum results [8] in d=4 supersymmetric gauge theories.  4. Resolving the Conifold Singularity In this section we explain, following a parallel discussion in [8], how the appearance of a massless black holes resolves the puzzle of conifold singularities mentioned in the introduction. We wish to understand the four-dimensional, N = 2 supersymmetric, lowenergy effective action resulting from Calabi-Yau compactification of type IIB string theory. At generic points in the moduli space, the massless fields will consist of the graviton multiplet, h21 vector multiplets and b2 + 1 hypermultiplets. We shall focus on the conifold singularities in the moduli space of the vector multiplet. Near a conifold at Z 1 = 0, the BPS state with n1 = 1 and all other charges equal to zero has a mass which vanishes as in (3.8). This state carries the minimal charge with respect to the U(1) gauge field which lies in a supermultiplet with the moduli field Z 1 , and is itself part of a hypermultiplet [24]. The low-energy effective action involving only moduli fields must break down near Z 1 = 0 because this state becomes light and can be excited. It should be replaced by an effective field theory in which the kinetic term of the Z 1 modulus does not diverge and there is an additional charged hypermultiplet. This is basically identical4 to a situation described in [8]. In the low energy Wilsonian effective action there are no logarithms in F1. However the one loop beta function obtains a contribution from the light charged hypermultiplet. Since the gauge coupling is a derivative of F1, this implies a one loop correction to F1 after integrating out the black hole hypermultiplet. This leads to  in agreement with (2.4). Thus the conifold singularity in the metric at Z 1 = 0 is just the usual type of singularity produced by intergrating out massless charged fields. 4.1. Classical vs. gs → 0 Limit There is something puzzling about the preceding comments. In [8] the singularity in the moduli space arises from nonperturbative quantum effects and is resolved by quantum loops of light monopoles. In our example the singularity arises in the classical moduli space. Naively it would seem impossible to resolve such a singularity by quantum loops of anything, since these should be suppressed as gs = e φ (where φ is the string dilaton) vanishes The surprising fact5 is that non-perturbative quantum effects are not all suppressed as gs → 0. Usually we think that in string theory ¯h appears in the combination ¯he2φ because a genus g surface is always accompanied by a factor of e 2(g−1)φ . This suggests where F is a RR field strength. This seems to contradict the expectation from string perturbation theory that the classical action should be proportional to e −2φ , but it is not a contradiction because [25,11] this factor could be reinstated in front of the second term by rescaling the potentials. However this would lead to peculiar gauge transformation laws and quantization conditions. There is no reason why nonperturbative effects associated with (4.2), which does not have a uniform overall factor of 1/g2 s , should behave as e −1/g2 s . We wish to see that, after an appropriate rescaling, loop effects of RR black holes contain no factors of gs. The fastest way to see this is to note that after rescaling the metric by e −2φ , the four dimensional effective action at generic points in the moduli space can be written in the form6 The dilaton φ lives in a hypermultiplet. N = 2 supersymmetry forbids neutral couplings between vector multiplets and hypermultiplets7 [16]. Thus the first two terms in the action are simply unaware of the value of gs. The black holes which becomes massless at the conifold points are soliton solutions involving only these two terms and are therefore also unaware of the value of gs. In a low energy effective field theory they will be represented by a hypermultiplet with a gs-independent action. Therefore quantum loops of these solitons do not involve gs. In conclusion, the gs → 0 limit of the low-energy effective action of the full quantum theory is very different than the low-energy effective action at string tree-level. The latter is inconsistent because of conifold singularities. The inconsistency may be resolved by the inclusion of non-perturbative quantum effects. 4.2. Degeneracies of States A second puzzle concerns the number of states which become light near a conifold. The mass of a state with n1 = 2 also vanishes. If this is interpreted as a charge-two, single-particle state, there would be an extra contribution to the beta function, ruining the agreement between (2.4) and (4.1). We therefore assume that this does not correspond to a single particle state. Rather it is a two-particle state consisting of two charge-one particles. The counting of extremal black hole states is a long-standing unsolved problem in quantum gravity. We do not know how to derive our assumption from first principles (except from the requirement of a consistent low-energy theory), but it can be supported by consideration of some other examples. A first example is the ‘t Hooft-Polyakov monopole. The charge-two solution is just a point in the moduli space of two charge-one solutions, and there is no separate charge-two monopole. However black hole moduli spaces are less well defined near the coincident point and the question is not so easy to answer. In a second example [14], minimally charged string solitons were constructed as extremal black holes in a K3 compactification of type IIA string theory. Closed loops of these solitons had just the right masses and degeneracies to provide the enhanced gauge symmetries at the points in moduli space where the K3 surface degenerates. However the soliton string solution can carry any axion charge. If the charge-two string had been viewed as distinct from two charge-one strings, a consistent picture would not have emerged. A related example is a fundamental string solution[27,28], which has just the right charge/mass ratio to be viewed as an extremal black hole [7]. If we treated the multiply-charged solutions as distinct objects, there would be an infinite number of gravitons! Other examples however seem to go against our assumption. In [11], the relation between type IIA string theory and d = 11 supergravity seems to require an infinite tower of distinct multiply-charged states. Also the spectrum of Dabohlkar-Harvey winding states [27,28] of heterotic string theory at charge two contains both a two-string state and a doubly-wound, one-string “bound state at threshold”. The higher n1 states discussed here might be viewed as a similar type of winding state. To summarize, consistency of the low energy theory seems to require that ther are no multiply-charged single-particle states. It would be interesting to verify (or disprove!) this from some other starting point, such as possibly a semiclassical analysis of the solutions and their moduli spaces. 4.3. Quantum Duality A further puzzle concerns the fact that the conifold singularities discussed herein arise in what is usually referred to as classical string theory, as opposed to the conifold singularities of N = 2, d = 4 Yang-Mills [8], which are not present classically but arise from quantum instanton corrections. This seems to be a radical difference. However there have been conjectures [28,27,29,25,30,31,11] that there exists a dual formulation of string theory in which fundamental strings arise as solitons. In any such dual formulation of string theory, a worldsheet instanton of the ordinary formulation of string theory will be a spacetime instanton leading to nonperturbative quantum effects. In type IIA string theory, the conifold singularities are produced by large effects from worldsheet instantons. In a dual formulation of the IIA string, the conifold singularities would then be interpreted as a nonperturbative instanton effect, exactly as in the N = 2 Yang-Mills case. Thus the idea of a dual formulation of string theory would dovetail nicely with the observations of this paper. Related phenomena were discussed in [32]. In [33], an Abelian Higgs model, which has soliton strings, was coupled to gravity. Instantons were found corresponding to a soliton string worldsheet wrapping around a black hole horizon. These instantons give nonperturbative corrections for example to the Hawking temperature. The strength of these effects goes as  where T is the soliton string tension and A is the area of the horizon. In [32] the same effect was considered in the context of fundamental string theory. In this case the instantons are fundamental string worldsheets wrapping around a black hole horizon, i.e. worldsheet instantons. The strength of the effects goes as 5. Conclusions In closing we mention that our analysis has brought to light several interesting features of string theory whose significance goes beyond the example discussed here: 1. Nonperturbative quantum effects of a certain restricted type may occur in string theory which are not suppressed as gs → 0. 2. Classical string theory is inconsistent without the inclusion of such effects. 3. The quantum consistency of string theory requires that extremal black holes be treated as elementary quanta.	Abstract Low-energy effective field theories arising from Calabi-Yau string compactifications are generically inconsistent or ill-defined at the classical level because of conifold singularities in the moduli space. It is shown, given a plausible assumption on the degeneracies of black hole states, that for type II theories this inconsistency can be cured by nonperturbative quantum effects: the singularities are resolved by the appearance of massless RamondRamond black holes. The Wilsonian effective action including these light black holes is smooth near the conifold, and the singularity is reproduced when they are integrated out. In order for a quantum effect to cure a classical inconsistency, it can not be suppressed by the usual string coupling gs. It is shown how the required gs dependence arises as a result of the peculiar couplings of Ramond-Ramond gauge fields to the dilaton.
11	1993	SOME SPECULATIONS ABOUT BLACK HOLE ENTROPY IN STRING THEORY	 Leonard Susskind 	SOME SPECULATIONS ABOUT BLACK HOLE ENTROPY IN STRING THEORY Abstract. The classical Bekenstein entropy of a black hole is argued to arise from configurations of strings with ends which are frozen on the horizon. Quantum corrections to this entropy are probably finite unlike the case in quantum field theory. Finally it is speculated that all black holes are single string states. The level density of strings is of the right order of magnitude to reproduce the Bekenstein entropy. I. Introduction There are some puzzles concerning the entropy of black holes which I would like to consider from the point of view of string theory. First of all the meaning of the Bekenstein entropy has always been mysterious. Entropy, as generally understood, has to do with the counting of configurations of some set of degrees of freedom. What the degrees of freedom of the horizon are and why they give entropy of order 1 / ~ has remained obscure. 2 The second puzzle concerns the higher order quantum corrections to the entropy. G ’tHooft has emphasized[1] that conventional quantum fields contribute an ultraviolet divergence to S which blows up at the horizon. This is despite the fact that no curvature or other invariant signal becomes large. The ultraviolet divergent entropy is proportional to the area and although down by a factor of ~ from SB it is infinitely larger.It has not been properly appreciated except by ’t Hooft that this ultraviolet divergence of S is the same problem as Hawking’s information paradox and that any theory which naturally produces a finite entropy will also solve this problem. From the perspective of a distant observer nothing ever reaches the horizon. Instead all matter settles into layers which eternally sink toward it. If the entropy of matter near the horizon is infinite, indefinite amounts of information can be stored arbitrarily close by. This information can not be emitted until the horizon shrinks to quantum mechanical proportions and perhaps not even then. By contrast, a theory in which the information storage capacity is finite has no choice but to reemit information as the horizon shrinks. In a previous paper[2] I showed that in string theory, from the outside observers vantage point, the substance of infalling strings not only never reaches the horizon but never entirely sinks past the stretched horizon. Therefore it seems appropriate to ask whether string theory leads to a finite entropy. The last puzzle concerns the connection between the spectrum of black holes and that of unperturbed strings. In both cases that level density increases rapidly with mass. Furthermore, most of the spectrum of strings must actually be black holes since they lie within their Schwarzschild radii. Nevertheless I do not know of any speculation that the two spectra may really be the same.[3] In fact at first sight such a suggestion seems nonsensical. The level density of black holes grows like exp 4πM2 while that of strings is exponential in the first power of the mass. We shall see that this argument is wrong and that the two spectra, when properly interpreted, could easily be the same. II. Thermodynamics in Rindler Space I will begin by outlining the procedures involved in constructing the thermodynamics of Rindler space. The euclidean continuation is ordinary flat space in cylindrical polar coordinates where the angular variable θ is the euclidean time, r is the radical variable (not to be confused with the Schwarzschild coordinate) and X⊥ is the 2 space parallel to the horizon. The horizon itself is the surface r = 0. The Rindler hamiltonian HR is the generator of θ-rotations. For physical applications β should be set equal to 2π. For the purposes of thermodynamic analysis it must be left as a free variable. Note that varying β is equivalent to introducing a conical singularity at the horizon with an angular deficit 2π − β. The free energy F(β) is given by where the Rindler temperature is TR = 1/β. Eq. 2.5 is the reason we need to be able to vary β away from 2π. Consider first the thermodynamics of a free scalar field. The partition function can be carried out as a sum over first quantized closed path particle trajectories in a well known manner. The only new ingredient is the conical singularity at r = 0. It is easy to see that paths which do not wind around r = 0 contribute no β dependence to the free energy. This means that they can be dropped when calculating the entropy. Thus we find that the entropy is the first order variation with respect to β of the sum of paths which wind one or more times around the horizon. This principle extends to interacting field theories described in terms of networks of paths forming Feynman diagrams. Only those networks which topologically encircle r = 0 contribute to entropy. It is clear that the entropy divergences found in conventional quantum field theory are due to very small loops near r = 0. Now I want to study black hole entropy using an analogous method. Consider the euclidean continuation of the Schwarzschild metric in which time is periodic. The geometry near r = 0 is identical to Rindler space. Far from the horizon 2.1 is modified to is the Schwarzshild time coordinate. The ordinary energy (mass) of a black hole is conjugate to Schwarzshild time and the conventional temperature is defined in terms of this energy. The energy and Schwarzshild temperature are given in terms of the mass by To compute from first principles directly in Rindler coordinates we must calculate the free energy of a euclidean black hole with an angle deficit of (2π − β). Again this introduces a conical singularity at the horizon. The lowest order contribution to F is order 1/~ and is given terms of the classical action. (2.14) F = 1 β Action The action consists of three distinct terms. The first is proportional to the integrated Ricci scalar which vanishes by virtue of the Einstein equations. The second involves the extrinsic curvature at the boundary at large r. This term is proportional to β and does not contribute to the entropy. The third contribution is due to the curvature delta function at the conical singularity. It is proportional to the horizon area and to the deficit angle 2π − β. Explicit calculation gives III. Black Hole Entropy in String Theory Evaluating the partition function in a conical background provides a general framework for calculating black hole entropy including the classical Bekenstein term and quantum corrections from both matter and gravitational field. To apply it to string theory requires formulating the theory in backgrounds with small 4 but arbitrary angle deficits. This has not been done. I will therefore restrict my remarks to certain general features. The free energy is given as a sum over world sheet configurations of arbitrary genus. By an argument similar to that used in field theory, the only nonvanishing contributions to the entropy come from world sheets which in some way wrap around or touch the singularity at the horizon. For example a torus can surround the horizon as in fig(1) This configuration describes the contribution to the entropy of a free closed string. This is seen by slicing the figure at some fixed euclidean time such as θ = 0 (See fig 2) Another configuration in which the horizon intersects the torus is shown in fig 3 In this case the instantaneous configurations involve strings with their ends frozen on the horizon as in fig 4 Such configurations must be included in the space of states of the black hole. The genus k surfaces contribute with a coefficient Gk−1 . Evidently the Bekenstein entropy corresponds to a genus zero surface with the topology of a sphere as in fig 5 These surfaces describe the evolution of a single string with ends on the horizon. In Minkowski space the endpoints of the string can not move because of the infinite time dilation at the horizon but the rest of the string is free to wiggle. This solves the puzzle of the origin of SB in String theory. One might wonder why the zero genus contributions do not vanish as they usually do in string theory. The reason involves both the conical singularity at the origin and the fact that the deficit angle at infinity does not vanish. The presence of these genus zero contributions very near the horizon is almost certainly related to a similar effect found by Atick and Witten[4] in high temperature string theory and large N QCD. We next turn to the question of the finiteness of the higher genus quantum corrections. In the absence of precise tools for quantizing strings on singular spaces I can only quote some circumstantial evidence for finiteness. However, before doing so we must take care of a trivial divergence associated with the infinite volume at spatial infinity. If the black hole is in thermal equilibrium with its environment, the nonvanishing temperature will cause a volume divergence in all extensive thermodynamical variables. This can be easily overcome by passing to the limit of infinite black hole mass. The resulting geometry is flat Rindler space with a deficit angle. In Rindler space-times of dimension greater than two the thermodynamical variables are infrared finite. The entropy per unit area is therefore well defined. As I have mentioned in sect 2 the ordinary field theoretic divergences in entropy arise from paths of vanishing length which encircle the horizon. In string theory the analogue of a path of given proper time is a torus with complex modular parameter τ . It is well known that the integration region over τ which could potentially cause ultraviolet divergences should be excised because it corresponds to an infinite overcounting of geometrically identical tori. There is no mechanism for generating ultraviolet divergences if the relevant loop integrals are anything like other string amplitudes. The finiteness of string theoretic loops is due to the extreme paucity of degrees of freedom at short distances. This lack of short distance structure is seen in several ways. 1) Atick and Witten have shown[4] that string theory behaves more softly at high temperatures than any possible continuum quantum field theory. Roughly 5 speaking the high temperature thermodynamics is consistent with a lattice theory in which the spacing is finite. Similar evidence comes from the work of Klebanov and Susskind[5] who show that exact string amplitudes can be derived from a spacetime lattice theory with non vanishing spacing. 2) High energy scattering amplitudes at fixed angle are the traditional method of uncovering short distance structure. Gross and Mende[6] have shown that such amplitudes vanish like gaussian functions of momentum transfer. 3) It appears to be impossible to force the dimensions of compact space dimensions to be smaller than a certain size of order ℓs.[7] 4) Following the progress of a string falling toward a horizon, an external observer fails to see the object Lorentz contract.[2] There appears to be a minimum longitudinal size that strings can occupy. Furthermore for non vanishing coupling there is a bound to the number of strings that can pass through a small region without inducing violent interactions. All these facts point to a common conclusion. When we attempt to localize strings or parts of strings in distances much smaller than ℓs we discover a complete lack of local degrees of freedom. This strongly suggests that higher genus contributions to black hole entropy is finite and that to an external observer, indefinite quantities of information can not collect arbitrarily near the event horizon. What is desperately needed is a computation to confirm this. IV. Black Holes as Single String States I turn now to a radically different way to estimate the entropy of a black hole. When strings fall on to a horizon an external observer sees them spread out and eventually fill the stretched horizon.[2] One can regard this phenomenon as a melting of strings as they encounter Hagedorn temperature conditions[4] at a distance ∼ ℓs from the event horizon. The entropy of single string states is so large that strings on the horizon will tend to form a single string when the Hagedorn temperature is approached. The implication is that all black hole states are in one to one correspondence with single string states. Now it has been observed in the past that the high mass-low angular momentum states of string theory must be black holes since they lie within their Schwarzshild radii. I would like to make the heretical suggestion that the spectrum of black holes and the spectrum of single string states are identical.[3] Furthermore this provides us with a direct way to estimate the number of levels and therefore the entropy. Before we can actually compare the spectra we must deal with somewhat trivial but numerically very important effect. The classical gravitational field outside the stretched horizon is not a low order effect. We must imagine removing the effects of this field before we try to compare low order string theory with black hole physics. The main effect which must be accounted for is the large red shift of clock rates that takes place between the stringy stretched horizon and an observer at infinity. In other words a rescaling of all energy levels of the black hole should be done. The stretched horizon is the place where the local Unruh temperature becomes hot enough for stringy effects to become important, i.e. the Hagedom temperature. Another way to think of the relation between E(S.H.) and M is that the long range field outside the stretched horizon renormalizes the mass from its “bare” value E(SH) to its renormalized value M. Therefore I would like to suggest that a black hole of mass M should be identified with a string state of mass E(S.H.). We can estimate the entropy of a black hole by counting the levels of fundamental strings. The number of states at mass level r = E satisfies  which says that the entropy is of order SB. It is therefore not inconsistent to suppose that a correspondence exists between black holes and fundamental string states. Vafa has pointed out that this correspondence may extend to extreme charged black holes. In this case the mass renormalization due to the gravitational field energy exactly cancels the electromagnetic energy so that string states of mass M should be compared with black holes of mass M. If, for example, we consider charge arising from winding modes then the minimum mass of a string of charge Q is proportional to Q. This corresponds exactly to the extremal black hole. If the view of black hole entropy in this section is correct then there can be little doubt that the quantum corrections to SB are finite. These quantum corrections would result from the finite shifting of levels due to higher genus world sheets. Finally I would like to mention an observable effect of the string theory on black hole evaporation. In the usual picture the final evaporation process takes place at planckian temperatures. The last radiated particles would carry energy of order the Planck mass. To best appreciate the difference that string theory makes, it is helpful to pretend that the string coupling g 2 = G/ℓ2 s is extremely small so that the Planck and string scales are extremely well separated. Let us consider the radius of an average excited string state of mass M, ignoring all higher order effects including the long range gravitational field. Ignoring quantum fluctuations of the st Thus for g ≪ 1 there is a large range of masses for which the conventional string configuration is larger than RSCH and no black hole behavior should occur. On the otherhand an evaporating black hole should behave conventionally until the red shift factor at the stretched horizon is of order unity. At this point there is no large red shift factor and strings should behave like strings. The mass at this point is Several things happen at this point. The first is that the area of the black hole horizon has become equal to ℓ 2 s . Second, the Hawking temperature has reached the Hagedorn temperature. Third, the conventional mass M and the stretched horizon energy E(S.H.) become equal. Finally at this point the Bekenstein entropy ∼ M2G2 becomes of order the string entropy M ℓs. Between Ma and Mb we have two descriptions, ie. string and black hole, both of which should apply but which disagree. The resolution of this inconsistency is that in this region there are two configurations. The first is metastable and describes a conventional string with radius larger than RSCH. The second, with larger entropy is stable and consists of a black hole with the string gravitationally collapsed to the stretched horizon. Below mass Mb the string entropy exceeds the black hole entropy so that the black hole becomes thermodynamically unstable. Accordingly when a black hole reaches the Hagedorn temperature it “inflates” to a string whose size exceeds that of a black hole by the factor 	Abstract. The classical Bekenstein entropy of a black hole is argued to arise from configurations of strings with ends which are frozen on the horizon. Quantum corrections to this entropy are probably finite unlike the case in quantum field theory. Finally it is speculated that all black holes are single string states.

12	1991	On the Evaporation of Black Holes in String Theory		"On the Evaporation of Black Holes in String Theory Abstract We show that, in string theory, the quantum evaporation and decay of black holes in two-dimensional target space is related to imaginary parts in higher-genus string amplitudes. These arise from the regularisation of modular infinities due to the sum over world-sheet configurations, that are known to express the instabilities of massive string states in general, and are not thermal in character. The absence of such imaginary parts in the matrix-model limit confirms that the latter constitutes the final stage of the evaporation process, at least in perturbation theory. Our arguments appear to be quite generic, related only to the summation over world-sheet surfaces, and hence should also apply to higher-dimensional target spaces. 1 Introduction and Summary Recently a lot of attention has been paid to black-hole solutions of two-dimensional string theories [1, 2, 3], which are discretized by certain matrix models describing c = 1 conformal matter coupled to the Liouville mode. This connection is possible thanks to the discovery of non-critical strings [4, 5], that has opened the way for studying non-trivial string dynamics. These string theories are described by noncompact coset Wess-Zumino models on an arbitrary world-sheet [2, 4]. They provide a powerful theoretical laboratory for seeing how ideas about black hole physics fare in the context of string theory. In particular, the existence of an infinite set of ‘W-hair’ sufficient to maintain quantum coherence has been conjectured and demonstrated [6, 7]. Several authors [8] have now extended the black-hole construction to higherdimensional target spaces by gauging more complicated groups,offering eventually the hope of understanding black holes in four-dimensional target space. So far all known black-hole solutions are static, which restricts their physical significance. One expects that physical black holes are produced by collapsing matter, and that quantum effects make them evaporate [9, 10]. Therefore, static solutions cannot be the whole story. The main purpose of this note to argue that the static character of the black hole is a feature only of the classical string tree level, and that formulating the theory on summed-up higher-genus world-sheets leads to quantum instabilities, that correspond to evaporation and decay of the black hole, and do not have a finite-temperature interpretation. These instabilities manifest themselves as imaginary parts in string correlation functions arising from the regularisation of modular infinities [11]. These imaginary parts are absent for the discrete states in the corresponding c = 1 matrix model, confirming (at least within string perturbation theory) their interpretation as the end-points of black hole evaporation, and strengthening their role as guardian angels of quantum coherence [6, 7]. We shall concentrate on the two-dimensional black-hole case although our arguments appear to be quite generic to the divergences emerging from world-surface summations, and can be applied to higher-dimensional cases as well. The outline of the paper is as follows: in section 2 we review briefly the origin of the imaginary parts in correlation functions in ordinary string theories. In section 3 we discuss some aspects of the two-dimensional strings that will be useful in our discussion. Section 4 is devoted to a discussion of string propagation in a Minkowskian black-hole background on the torus. We construct the corrections to the tree-level effective action coming from summing up genus-zero and -one worldsheet surfaces, and show explicitly the existence of imaginary mass-shifts for the black-hole solution. The latter are interpreted as a signal for evaporation induced by quantum effcts in target space-time. In section 5 we discuss the interpretation of the Euclidean (thermal) black hole, and in section 6 we briefly discuss higherdimensional target-space black holes. Finally, we present some conclusions and discuss prospects for future progress in section 7.  2 Critical String Theory in Higher Genera There is a rather extensive literature on this issue [12, 13, 14, 15]. Here we shall recall only the parts that are relevant for our purposes, namely the regularisation of modular infinities arising from summing over world-sheet tori in the one-string-loop approximation. The relevant analysis has been done first by Marcus [11], whose method will be followed here. Consider an N-point tachyon amplitude in closed bosonic string theory. Unitarity requires factorisation in the sense that the amplitude exhibits poles whenever a particular combination of external momenta approaches an ‘on-shell’ value for any of the intermediate string modes. The formal origin of the amplitude poles can be traced back to the well-known operator product singularity, which occurs when two (or more) of the vertex operators approach each other. Using the factorisation formula, and combining the tree and torus amplitudes, one can deduce a mass renormalisation for the intermediate massive string modes, which was discussed by Weinberg [16]. The relevant mass shift is given by the two-point function on the torus: The latter expression in general diverges when one sums over tori, as required in a string theory formulation. Such a procedure involves integration over the Teichmuller parameters τ = τ1 + iτ2 which describe the various tori (e.g. τ2 is related to the area of the torus). The modular infinities arise from the region of the τ2 integration where τ2 → ∞, i.e. large tori, and are, therefore, considered by many as ‘infrared’ infinities. As Marcus [11] observed, the relevant part of the divergences encountered in generic string amplitudes is similar in structure to the ‘tachyon’ infinity of the bosonic string. This means that even in the superstring case, where the tachyons are absent, there will be infinities of the form where the integration is over the part of the fundamental region which is above the cut-off R. The final results expressing regularised divergences turn out, as expected, to be independent of R. The rest of the τ -integration over M′ < R yields modular-convergent results that we shall not be concerned with in this note. The quantity ∆12 is a cusp form of weight 12, related to the Dedekind η-function by  12 , in standard notation with q = exp(i2πτ ). In the It should be stressed again that this type of divergence, although it is similar in form to the ones induced by tachyons in bosonic strings, exists independently of tachyons in the theory. This will be relevant for the case of two-dimensional strings, where the tachyons are massless. Divergences of the form (4) exist in that case as well. Marcus [11] applied analytic continuation to regularise these modular divergences. He used the integral  The imaginary part of the integral is independent of R, as expected, and constitutes the only remnant of the divergence [11]: In this way , in ordinary string theories one evaluates the imaginary part of the oneloop induced cosmological constant of the bosonic string, expressing the instability of the false tachyonic vacuum. Imaginary parts, similar to the one appearing in the cosmological constant, also appear in higher-point functions of massive string modes, and reflect decay of the massive states with life-times determined by Γ = −Im(δm), where δm is the mass shift of the state in question. In closed bosonic strings, imaginary parts also appear in the two- and three-point functions of the (massless) graviton-dilaton multiplet, whose mass is now shifted due to the induced cosmological constant term. This graviton mass shift is consistent with general covariance [17]. Such lowest-order computations of string amplitudes contain information about the string effective action, to lowest order in target-space derivatives, or equivalently to first order in the Regge slope parameter α ′ . The oneloop amplitudes, involving an integration over tori, yield in this way a cosmological constant term and a shift in the Einstein term of the effective string action [12, 14]. in ζ-function regularisation, where γ is Euler’s constant. The logarithmic 1 ε divergence in (9) is ‘absorbed’ in the dilaton tadpole, and corresponds to higher-genus corrections to tree-level beta-function equations (local infinities) [15]. This is a rather general rule [11]. Logarithmic divergences are the ones that cannot be regularised by analytic continuation. In addition to these divergences there are τ2 modular infinities arising from the region of τ2 integration where τ2 → ∞.The latter are the types of divergences that are going to interest us in this note. They can be regularised by analytic continuation in the way outlined in (5), yielding imaginary parts of the form (7). Indeed, the leading τ2 divergences in the cosmological constant and Einstein parts of the action (8) are similar in form, up to irrelevant proportionality constants,1 and are of the type (5). The regulated expressions have imaginary parts which in ordinary bosonic string theories are attributed to the tachyonic contributions in the string tadpole graphs. However, as Marcus [11] noticed, such divergences exist also in superstring theories where they express the decay of massive string states. For instance, N-point superstring amplitudes involving massless modes as external states contain similar divergences expressing the decay rates of the exchanged states. 3 Aspects of Two-dimensional Bosonic Strings The consistent formulation of closed bosonic string theory in two target-space dimensions is possible, provided one allows for non-trivial backgrounds. It is sufficient to have a non-zero dilaton background which is linear in the ‘spatial’ target space coordinate, associated with the Liouville mode [4, 5, 18]. The only propagating field in this string theory is the scalar ‘tachyon’ mode - which is however massless in two dimensions. The rest of the string modes are ‘topological’ in the sense that they make non-trivial contributions to amplitudes only for particular values of the energy and momenta [19]. There is a simple reason for this. Consider, for example, the first massive’ string multiplet that consists of the graviton-dilaton modes. The massive character of the multiplet is due to the cosmological constant terms in the action, as a result of the non-critical dimensionality of space-time. The graviton is massive with mass proportional to Q = q25−c 3 = 2√ 2 (c = 1). The conformal invariance conditions on a flat space read [20, 6]where hµν is the polarisation tensor for the graviton-dilaton multiplet, Qµ = (Q, 0) and the tilde denotes Q-conjugation in the sense of [19] 2 . In two-dimensional target space, the above relations imply the decoupling of all the gravitons whose momenta are different from 0 or −Q,since they are longitudinal and hence can be gauged away. However, for the discrete values 0 or −Q there is a discontinuity in the degrees of freedom, and extra modes become relevant. Due to the definite energy and momentum they possess, their propagators cannot be defined, since the latter involve analytic continuations off-mass-shell. It is in this sense that these modes are considered ‘semi-topological’ or ‘of co-dimension two’ [19]. The same is true for all the higher string modes. Each one of them is associated with a stringy gauge symmetry, leading to Ward identities satisified by the relevant string amplitudes defined on-shell [22, 6] 3 . Such Ward identities imply the gauging away of any massive mode whose momentum is off mass-shell, and this is the reason why in two dimensions the only remnants of the higher string states are discrete semi-topological modes 4 . The impossibility of applying analytic continuation to the mass-shell of the discrete massive states of the two-dimensional string implies the absence of any modular infinities in closed string loops associated with these modes. If this were not the case, then according to the Marcus analysis [11] it would be impossible to regulate such divergences either by absorbing them in tree-level σ-model coupling constants, or by analytic continuation, and therefore the theory would be sick. Fortunately this is not the case. It can be shown, when considering tachyon amplitudes on the torus, that the only propagating field in the loop is again the tachyon whilst the massive states yield non-zero but finite contributions [19]. The latter result has also been confirmed in the Das-Jevicki [24] string field theory approach to the c = 1 matrix model, where it has been shown that the extra discrete states yield non-zero but real contributions to the scattering amplitudes of the massless propagating fields (tachyons) of the theory [25]. 4 Minkowskian Two-dimensional Black Holes and the Summation over Riemann Surfaces The previous Ward-identity arguments about the decoupling of higher string states except at discrete values of their momenta do not apply if some of the modes’ polarisation tensors exhibit singularities, as is the case of target space-time black holes [1, 2]. In that case, the familiar Einstein terms in the effective action for graviton-dilaton modes appear, and one finds the black-hole solutions by the usual variational principles that one applies to dynamical graviton fields in ordinary pointlike theories. It will be useful, for subsequent purposes, to recall some of the basic properties of the static black hole solutions in 2D string theory. Such objects are found as solutions of the beta function equations for a bosonic σmodel to lowest order in the Regge slope parameter α ′ . It was Witten’s observation [2] that such constructions on an arbitrary Riemann surface arise from appropriate gauging of a Wess-Zumino coset model 5 on SL(2,R) U(1) with the correspondence of k −2 to 1 4πα′ , where k is the level parameter of the Wess-Zumino term.The lowest order (in α ′ ) solutions of the σ-model correspond therefore to the large-k limit of the grouptheoretic model. The effective action at tree level for graviton-dilaton backgroundswhere for our discussion we ignore matter (tachyon) parts. In two-dimensional target spaces the non-trivial solutions of the equations of motion obtained from (11) are of black-hole type [1, 2], leading to singular metrics in a certain coordinate system, although, as usual, such singularities can be eliminated by going to an appropriate coordinate system. The black hole solutions are static and can be thought of as the classical final state of gravitational collapse of two-dimensional matter [26]. The mass of the black hole is essentially determined by an arbitrary constant α, which expresses a shift in the dilaton field. Indeed, if we make the change φ → φ + α, the mass of the black hole turns out to be [2] Mbh = q 2 k−2 e α . The family of black where ρ is the space coordinate (Liouville mode). In the limiting case M → 0, the black hole solution (12) becomes identical to a Q-graviton perturbation, which can, at least in this sense, be identified with the last stage of black hole evaporation. In addition to the graviton mode, all the rest of the higher massive string modes are also excited. This underpins the interpretation of the continuum version of the c = 1 matrix model as the final stage of the black-hole evaporation, as conjectured by Witten [2]. It is the purpose of this section to discuss the origin of the evaporation proccess. In ordinary local gravity theories the evaporation of a black hole is a quantum phenomenon which must therefore be associated with loop corrections [9, 10]. If a similar mechanism operates in our case, one should expect to see the evaporation process when one performs the sum over world-sheet genera, that represents the string analogue of the loop corrections to the gravity action. This is precisely what happens in our case, as we shall argue below. We shall demonstrate our arguments by restricting ourselves to the torus case, which is sufficient for our purpose. There is also a formal reason for this. In a stringy formulation of two-dimensional quantum gravity, the Liouville field is usually considered as a free field whose space is unrestricted. However, since this mode is associated with the covariant shortdistance cut-off in the theory, it is natural to think of it as being bounded from below at a value defining the cut-off, α, in a flat two-dimensional world-sheet [27]. Representing the covariant cut-off, then, as e ρα, the ρ integration extends from 0 to ∞ [20]. These ‘boundaries’ in Liouville space have important consequences for Liouville energy non-conservation in string amplitudes, except in the torus case [20]. To see this in a simplified way, let us complexify the Liouville field by going to the iρ-formalism, and therefore considering complex two-dimensional surfaces. Due to boundaries in the integration over the zero-modes of ρ, the result in string amplitudes is not a delta-function conservation of the energy associated with the coordinate ρ (in a Fourier expansion of the backgrounds) but rather resonant forms 1 s [19], where s = P i ε(ki) + Q(g − 1), with β µ ≡ (ǫ(k), k) being the two-vectors representing conformal charges in the Liouville and matter sectors, and the sum is over states in the relevant string amplitude. The residues of these resonances are the string amplitudes we are considering [19]. In any other topology except that of the torus, the Liouville energy conservation law is modified by the ‘charge at infinity’ Q [4, 19]. At genus one one there is exact energy conservation despite the presence of Q. This makes the contribution of this particular topology somewhat special. This also implies that the regularisation of the associated modular infinities coming from this topology could not be cancelled by higher genera. 8 After these parenthetic remarks we are now in a position to discuss the evaporation of the static black hole solution (12) induced by quantum effects in the torus case. Energy conservation, even in the in Liouville sector, implies that the torus computation can be considered formally identical to the one in critical strings outlined in previous sections. The only point that deserves attention concerns the role of the target-space dimensionality. In the case of closed bosonic strings living in noncritical dimensions D of target space-time the (modular invariant) torus partition function is given by [4] ZD = (2τ2) 2−D 2 (η(τ )η(τ ))2−D (13) Naively one expects no modular τ2 infinities in D = 2, and indeed this is the case in matrix model backgrounds [29]. However, when computing correlation functions in Liouville theory with a world-sheet cosmological constant it seems necessary to continue analytically the matter central charge [28], which in turn implies a formal continuation away from the D = 2 value. Upon such a procedure, which could be viewed as the analogue of target-space dimensional regularisation, loop corrections to the string effective action acquire, in the limit D → 2 +, finite imaginary parts from the regularisation of τ2-modular infinities that appear in the case D > 2, as becomes clear from (13). Similarly to the critical string theory, the imaginary parts of the corrections to the Einstein term of the two-dimensional string are given by the α → 0 and β → 0 limit of (7): the result is π. The imaginary parts of the torus correction to the (tree-level) cosmological constant, on the other hand, are given by (7) upon setting α = ε → 0, β = 1: the result is ε π 2 6 . Hence, in the case of two-dimensional strings there are no imaginary parts in the one-string-loop corrected cosmological constant. This reflects the stability of the two-dimensional flat-space tachyonic vacuum, which is massless. The important point is that the proportionality constant in front of the Einstein term can be identified with the mass of the black hole [2]. If a represents a constant shift in the dilaton, then, by computing the stress-tensor of the graviton-dilaton system (in the absence of matter) one can determine the (conserved) energy, i.e. mass, of the black hole as Mbh = s Therefore, the torus contribution is to shift the mass of the tree-level black hole by an amount related to an infinite integral over the moduli space of genus-one surfaces. The latter, as we have mentioned, has both logarithmic divergences, that can be absorbed in a renormalisation of the dilaton field at tree-level `a la Fischler and Susskind [15], and modular τ2 infinities whose analytic continuation and regularisation yield imaginary parts in the black-hole mass shifts 7 . The situation, therefore, is similar in nature to what happens in critical string theories, where massive string states acquire complex mass-shifts in higher genera, reflecting their decay with a life-time inversely proportional in magnitude to the imaginary part of the pertinent mass-shift. In our case it is the Minkowski black-hole state that is unstable due to quantum effects, although classically, at the tree string-level, it is a stable background configuration. It is in this sense that we exhibit the evaporation of the two-dimensional quantum black hole. In this point of view, evaporation is expressed as an instability of the black hole vacuum with respect to stringy quantum corrections. It should be stressed that imaginary parts arising from the regularisation of modular τ2-infinities appear in any target-space dimensionality D ≥ 2, which gives a sort of universality to this decay mechanism. This mechanism for evaporation is purely stringy and has no counterpart in local gravity theories. The imaginary parts that express the instability arise from the regularisation of large-area tori, and therefore rely on the concept of an underlying world-sheet structure, i.e. string theory. This is to be contrasted with local point-like theories of gravity, where such phenomena do not occur. One could still refer to this type of process as ‘Hawking radiation’, due to the fact that it is triggered by quantum effects, but is not thermal as in the local field theory case.We cannot, however, yet exclude the possibility that thermal instabilities might arise in our picture in higher-dimensional target-spaces. We can now answer questions concerning the manner of the black hole evaporation, as well as its final stage. As argued in [6, 7] there is an infinity of gauge conservation laws that accompany black hole solutions in two-dimensional strings, which express stringy gauge symmetries associated with the infinite tower of string states. These laws imply the existence of conserved charges that constitute the ‘hair’ of black holes. These quantum numbers, being expressible as total spatial derivatives, remain conserved during the evaporation process, thereby restricting the modes of blackhole radiation. It can be shown that the gauge group associated with these charges contains classical w∞-symmetries [30] which preserve the phase-space area (twodimensional volume) of the matrix model [31]. There is no loss of quantum coherence due to the evaporation process, for the reasons explained in [7]. From the observation that the vanishing mass limit of the black-hole solution describes the Q-graviton and the other discrete topological states of the two-dimensional string, as well as the fact that the contribution of the latter to scattering amplitudes determining the matrixmodel target-space effective action contains no imaginary parts, we conclude that the continuum version of the c = 1 matrix model constitutes, at least in string perturbation theory, the final stage of black-hole evaporation. Unfortunately, it is not known how to perform in the continuum language the sum over genera in closed string cases [32]. The matrix model approach for c < 1 looks helpful, but the situation concerning c = 1 matrix models is still unclear. However, in our case we have shown that higher-genus corrections make black hole solutions unstable even in perturbation theory, thereby implying their decay (evaporation). At least as far as two-dimensional continuum string theory is concerned, the perturbation theory result seems to indicate that the flat-space linear dilaton background solution of the latter is the final point of the evaporation. It is of course possible that non-perturbative effects lead to a different end-point, but such a possibility goes beyond the scope of this analysis. A final comment we would like to make in this section concerns the possibility of regarding the static (classical) black hole solution as the result of some sort of gravitational collapse. This would be useful in considering the two-dimensional black hole as a laboratory for the study of higher-dimensional physically interesting cases, where such phenomena occur. In two dimensions the concept of collapsing matter is not obvious. The matter-stress tensor obtained naively from the Einstein tensor vanishes, since in two-dimensional target spaces Rµν − 1 2GµνR vanishes identically. However, in string effective theories there are non-trivial dilaton terms that accompany the Einstein curvature term in the effective action. Their presence make the matter (tachyon) stress tensor non-zero even classically [6, 33]. Shifting the dilaton field by a constant defines a family of objects characterised by various masses. Thus collapsing matter could lead to a black-hole. By matching - in the boundary of the dust (matter) - the static black hole solutions studied in [2, 3], with the solutions obtained from non-zero matter-stress tensors, it can be shown [26] that the former correspond to the final state of such a collapse, at the classical level. 5 Euclidean Black Holes Euclidean black holes are described by coset models in which the gauged subgroup of the SL(2, R) is compact. They can be thought of as being obtained from the euclideanisation of the Minkowski time [2]. From the point of view of Liouville theory, Euclidean black holes correspond to a two-dimensional Liouville theory coupled to matter described by a field compactified on a circle [29, 34]. In such models the partition function on the torus is known to possess no modular τ2 infinities, since the pertinent η-function factors cancel between Liouville and matter sectors [29]. In physical terms, this means that such black holes are static thermal objects which are in constant interaction with a heat bath, and therefore one does not expect them to lose any mass [3]. We cannot yet exclude the possibility that in higher-dimensional target spaces, there might be thermal instabilities of such objects in higher genera, due to the non-cancellation of η-factors that generate modular infinities. However, there is no example known so far that supports this idea. For instance, in certain string theories, like the open D = 4 string [35], it is known that below the Hage11 dorn temperature, although there exist thermal mass shifts which do not occur in the zero-temperature formalism [36], nevertheless they are modular finite. It might therefore be that there exists some sort of cancellation of ‘infrared’ infinities in thermal (static) string configurations, at least in certain cases [37]. However such an analysis falls beyond the scope of the present work. Before closing this section it is worth mentioning another difference between the Euclidean and the Minkowski framework within the context of two-dimensional strings. In models with a compactified matter boson field (as is also the case of c < 1 matrix models) the form of the Ward identities that express certain stringy symmetries is modified with respect to the uncompactified case. The higher string modes do not decouple any longer due to the discrete matter momenta. Consider, for instance, the graviton-dilaton Ward identity expressing general covariance of the theory. In the compactified case it reads [22, 19]  The right hand-side part is a contact term and vanishes ‘on-shell’ for the uncompactified case due to analyticity properties (the well-known [38] ‘cancelled propagator argument’). This is no longer true in the compact case due to the discrete momenta in the matter sector [19]. This can be interpreted formally as the breakdown of general covariance which is to be expected in a thermal theory. This is one of the main differences between Minkowskian and Euclidean formalisms of the c = 1 string theory. 6 Higher-Dimensional Target Spaces Analogous descriptions of higher-dimensional singular space-times seem possible. Support for this was recently given in a number of works [8, 39] where it was shown that by gauging more complicated coset Wess-Zumino models (even supersymmetric ones [39]) on arbitrary Riemann surfaces, one can get interesting singular field configurations for higher dimensional target spaces, among which one finds black holes [40] and black strings [41]. In view of the arguments presented in this work, the summation over Riemann surfaces is expected to lead to instabilities in the Minkowski formalism. That this is indeed the case can be demonstrated explicitly by looking at the four-dimensional black hole of ref. [40] and the three-dimensional black string of [41]. Let us start from the latter. The existence of the antisymmetric tensor field Bµν (which is gauged away in two dimensions) leads to a conventional axionic charge Q for the black hole, in addition to its mass M. For completeness, we briefly outline the construction [41]. One adds a free boson field z to the Wess-Zumino action, which is equivalent to considering a group G = SL(2, R)×R. Then one gauges an appropriate one-dimensional subgroup 12 generated by that of the two-dimensional case [2] together with a translation in the boson field z. This leads to two arbitrary parameters in the problem, the WessZumino level parameter k, and an extra parameter, λ, which is associated with the translation of z. The effective action describing gravitational dynamics contains again a non-trivial dilaton conformal factor acompanying the Einstein term. In non-singular curvature cases in dimensions higher than two, one can absorb these factors in a conformal rescaling of the graviton. However, we choose not to do it in singular cases such as black strings. The reason is that the arbitrariness in shifting the dilaton field by a constant α determines a family of solutions characterised by various values of Q and M [41],  The summation over higher genera will produce imaginary parts in α and therefore one has complex shifts for the black hole mass and axion charge, which are again interpreted as signal for evaporation. The quantum three-dimensional black string will therefore evaporate parts of its mass and axion charge. The exact conservation of these quantum numbers (due to their being total space derivatives) implies that the evaporated parts of the charges have to be carried away by particles emitted from the black hole. In a similar way, one can study four-dimensional black hole solutions [40]. These may be obtained by twisted products of one Euclidean and one Minkowskian twodimensional black hole. The antisymmetric tensor vanishes in this case, but the four-dimensional metric is off-diagonal. Again the role of the dilaton field is essential in defining families of solutions, and our arguments on the instabilities induced by higher genera apply as in the black string case. One can even construct direct higher-dimensional black holes by gauging more complicated Wess-Zumino models, involving antisymmetric tensor fields [42]. In such a case there is axionic charge on the black hole solutions. From standard field-theoretic arguments [43] one expects the three-dimensional black hole not to evaporate all of its axion charge. Similarly to the two-dimensional case, however, one expects quantum coherence to be restored, not because of the axion charge alone, but because of an infinity of hair provided by the higher string modes. In two dimensions this type of hair is phase-space area-preserving [7, 31]. In view of the general description of black holes by WessZumino models, and the relation of the latter in certain cases to such area-preserving (w-type) symmetries [44] we conjecture that the existence of a phase-space volumeelement-preserving symmetry is a general feature of such a Wess-Zumino theory, and thus coherence is maintained during the evaporation process. This fits in with the observation [45] that the Hawking temperature of an evaporating black hole is reduced as the amount of hair characterising the black hole is increased. This leads Another comment concerns the extension of these ideas to supersymmetric cases. Supersymmetric Wess-Zumino models have been considered [46] with the result that the effective two-dimensional theory describes supersymmetric σ-models in black hole backgrounds. In space-time supersymmetric backgrounds there are nonrenormalisation theorems [13] that prevent the Einstein terms from receiving corrections in higher genera. This is equivalent to the vanishing of the dilaton tadpoles in supersymmetric string theories. One might naively think that the breaking of spacetime supersymmetry by the black hole background seems to be essential in allowing imaginary parts in the higher-genus corrections to the mass of the black hole, and hence leading to evaporation in a way similar to the bosonic case. However, in view of Marcus’s analysis [11], instabilities of the kind discussed in the present work also appear in superstring theories, expressing in general the decays of massive states. An explicit example of such a situation is the type-I open superstring [47]. Thus we expect that a similar mechanism of non-thermal black hole decay will also operate in superstrings and heterotic strings. 7 Conclusions and Prospects Let us now summarise the view of black hole quantum physics that has emerged from this analysis and our previous papers [6, 7]. We have identified an infinite set of gauge w-symmetries that are sufficient to maintain quantum coherence for twodimensional black holes [6], and characterize an infinite set of ‘topological states’ that constitute the final states of black hole evolution described by a matrix model [48]. These w-symmetries have the geometrical interpretation [31] of preserving the phase-space volume-element of the matrix model, and thereby exclude [7] the general form of non-quantum-mechanical, non-Hamiltonian modification of the evolution equation for the density matrix [49], which would otherwise have caused all quantum-mechanical systems to appear ‘open’ as a conjectured consequence of microscopic space-time topology change [50]. In this paper we have shown that the evaporation of two-dimensional Minkowskian black holes can be understood as a quantum instability appearing in higher genera, analogously to the normal decays of massive string states [11]. This mechanism for Minkowskian black hole decay does not have a direct thermal interpretation, and, moreover, the two-dimensional Euclidean finite-temperature black hole solution [3] is static and does not exhibit this decay instability [29]. It is now appropriate to speculate on the possible extension of these results to four-dimensional black holes. As yet, there is no general characterisation of four8This is consistent with the fact that the two-dimensional black hole under consideration resembles an extreme Reissner-Nordstrom type [2]. 14 dimensional stringy black holes at the conformal field theory level, but some partial results are becoming available [8]. These generalize, and often incorporate, the noncompact coset Wess-Zumino models describing the two-dimensional solutions. As such, we expect them to include and extend the w-symmetries that save quantum coherence in two dimensions. A very large set of gauge symmetries is in fact known to exist in generic four-dimensional string models [22], possibly in correspondence to the number of massive string states and providing an amount of ‘hair’ sufficient to quench the entropy usually associated with four-dimensional black holes 9 . It certainly seems that the intrinsically stringy non-thermal higher-genus black hole decay mechanism identified in this paper could carry over to four dimensions, although we cannot yet exclude the existence of additional thermal instabilities. It seems that the string answer to the conundrum of reconciling quantum mechanics with general relativity is at hand."	Abstract We show that, in string theory, the quantum evaporation and decay of black holes in two-dimensional target space is related to imaginary parts in higher-genus string amplitudes. These arise from the regularisation of modular infinities due to the sum over world-sheet configurations, that are known to express the instabilities of massive string states in general, and are not thermal in character. The absence of such imaginary parts in the matrix-model limit confirms that the latter constitutes the final stage of the evaporation process, at least in perturbation theory. Our arguments appear to be quite generic, related only to the summation over world-sheet surfaces, and hence should also apply to higher-dimensional target spaces.
13	2011	Lifshitz black holes in string theory	Irene Amadoa and Anton F. Faedob	Lifshitz black holes in string theory Abstract: We provide the first black hole solutions with Lifshitz asymptotics found in string theory. These are expected to be dual to models enjoying anisotropic scale invariance with dynamical exponent z = 2 at finite temperature. We employ a consistent truncation of type IIB supergravity to four dimensions with an arbitrary 5-dimensional Einstein manifold times a circle as internal geometry. New interesting features are found that significantly differ from previous results in phenomenological models. In particular, small black holes are shown to be thermodynamically unstable, analogously to the usual AdS-Schwarzschild black holes, and extremality is never reached. This signals a possible Hawking-Page like phase transition at low temperatures. 1 Introduction The targets of the gauge/gravity duality have been vastly increased with the appreciation that it can be applied to strongly coupled condensed matter systems [1–3]. Among the phenomena of interest we encounter phase transitions governed by fixed points enjoying the anisotropic scaling t → λ z t while x → λx. The parameter z is termed dynamical exponent, and z = 1 corresponds to the familiar scale invariance of the conformal group. Clearly, a departure from this value breaks conformality and thus the gravity dual cannot be an AdS space. Two different holographic realizations of this symmetry have been proposed. The first one is expected to model cold atoms at unitarity and the corresponding metrics were constructed in [4, 5]. For the particular value z = 2 the isometry group of this space coincides with the invariance group of the Schr¨odinger equation and in consequence they are called Schr¨odinger geometries. The second avatar, Lifshitz geometries, is the focus of this paper. This class of metrics are named after the Lifshitz field theory that is supposed to arise as the long wavelength (continuous) limit of lattice models of strongly correlated electrons. They were introduced in [6] precisely as gravity duals of such systems and read where L sets the scale of the spacetime and for z = 1 one recovers AdS in Poincar´e coordinates. In addition to anisotropic scaling if r → λ −1 r, the isometries of these metrics include spacetime translations along with space rotations. Often the approach to condensed matter holography is phenomenological, with no manifest connection to string or M-theory. The matter content of the gravitational model is selected with the sole purpose of supporting the metrics of interest and give rise to the desired properties. For instance, the Lifshitz metric (1.1) is a solution of AdS gravity coupled to a massive vector [7] if one tunes the mass and the cosmological constant to m2 = z (d−2)L −2 and 2Λ = −  z 2 + (d − 3)z + (d − 2)2  L −2 respectively. Notice that both the dynamical exponent and the dimensionality of the spacetime enter in these expressions. The flexibility of the phenomenological models is certainly an advantage and much insight can be gained with this modus operandi. Nonetheless, gauge/gravity dualities are firmly established just in the context of string theories and one could be skeptical about the legitimacy of bottom-up constructions. In other words, it is important to verify that the relevant solutions can also be obtained within string or M-theory. Unfortunately, as one can presume, this is a more intricate task. However, many important steps have been taken in this direction. By now we have at our disposal embeddings into string theory of holographic superconductors [8, 9] as well as the Schr¨odinger spaces mentioned above [10–12]. Lifshitz geometries have proven to be more elusive, but they were recently found in [13–17]. Consistent truncations have been instrumental in obtaining various of these solutions. They provide lower-dimensional simplified setups with respect to 10 or 11-dimensional supergravities. Compared to phenomenological models they have the virtue that the embedding of the solution into string theory is automatic. The drawback is rigidity, in the sense that the parameters of the theory, such as masses and charges, are fixed during the reduction. Coming back to the example of Lifshitz this means that, either one is working with a consistent truncation containing a massive vector and a cosmological constant with the exact values given above, or the solution is not there. One could then rephrase the search for Lifshitz solutions in string theory as the chase for a vector with the correct mass. An important point was the observation that one can keep the appropriate massive modes in the reduction of higher-dimensional supergravities [10]. Stimulated by this result, several consistent truncations containing massive vectors were subsequently found [16, 18–23]. Nevertheless, none of the vectors included in those truncations seemed to have the correct mass (except one in [16] that gives z ∼ 39). A proper vector to support Lifshitz metrics with z = 2 was identified in [13] and further exploited to construct infinite families of solutions in [14, 17]. On the other hand, it is known since the dawn of the AdS/CFT duality that introducing temperature in the gauge theory corresponds to placing a black hole in the bulk of the gravity side. When the gauge theory is conformal, the corresponding black hole has AdS asymptotics in the boundary. Similarly, since the Lifshitz field theory is endowed with anisotropic scale invariance, the pertinent black holes describing its finite temperature generalization must have the metric (1.1) as asymptotic geometry. Black holes possessing this property have been extensively studied in phenomenological models, starting with the d = 4, z = 2 numerical ones of [24]. Extensions to other dimensionalities and critical exponents are available as well [25–28]. The charged case is also interesting for condensed matter applications [29–31]. Lifshitz black holes are also solutions of higher-order theories of gravity [32–35] and Brans-Dicke models [36]. Even if most of the results are numeric, a few exact black holes are known [37, 38]. Thermodynamic properties of these systems are detailed in [39, 40].  Despite all this considerable effort, a proper embedding of Lifshitz black holes into string theory was still missing.1 In this work, we construct an infinite family of d = 4, z = 2 Lifshitz black holes in type IIB supergravity. Building on the results of [14, 17], we present a consistent truncation based on E5 × S 1 , where E5 is an arbitrary 5-dimensional Einstein space, that contains a massive vector suitable for supporting the solution. In addition it incorporates two scalars, the dilaton and the modulus of the circle, whose presence complicates the study of the equations but triggers interesting new features with respect to the more minimal phenomenological models. In particular, we find no extremal limit and an instability for small black holes similar to the usual AdS-Schwarzschild one. This signals to a possible Hawking-Page like transition [42] in these systems. The structure of the paper is simple: in section 2 we construct the consistent truncation and present the 4-dimensional model and its equations of motion, in section 3 we solve numerically the equations and comment on the properties of the black holes found and in section 4 we conclude. 2 The model In accordance with the results of [17], a 4-dimensional Lifshitz space with z = 2 can be attained starting from a model in five dimensions containing an axion field and admitting an AdS5 vacuum. The mechanism is the following: if the 5d theory is reduced on S1 while using the axion field strength to thread a flux, the vector gauging the circle isometry has the correct mass to support the 4d Lifshitz solution. In this section we will provide a very simple model, coming from a consistent truncation of type IIB supergravity, that meets these requirements and thus is suitable for the embedding of Lifshitz-like solutions into string theory. Using an ansatz that generalizes the metric (1.1) to allow for a horizon, we derive the complete set of equations to be solved. A straightforward way to get an AdS5 solution in type IIB is to compactify on a 5- dimensional Einstein space E5 with a Freund-Rubin ansatz for the RR 5-form. On the other hand, the most natural candidate for the axion would be the RR scalar C0. Indeed, as already mentioned in [17], the model obtained in this manner is a consistent truncation of type IIB supergravity as long as one retains in addition the dilaton φ. In detail, we take the 10-dimensional metric to be  where M5 is for the time being an arbitrary 5-dimensional spacetime and the internal Einstein metric is normalized as Rij = 4 gij . By assumption the axio-dilaton has sole dependence on the M5 coordinates and from the set of forms the only non-vanishing one is Notice the presence of a negative cosmological constant Λ = −6 that emerges from a combination of the internal space curvature and the 5-form flux. It is then apparent that the model contains an AdS5 vacuum for constant scalars. In order to find the 4-dimensional Lifshitz solution one needs to further reduce the theory on a circle with metric  The scalar T(x) is a modulus parameterizing the size of the S1 while the vector A(x) is gauging the reparameterization invariance of the coordinate ϑ on the circle. Both depend exclusively on the coordinates of the 4d spacetime, denoted collectively x. This vector turns out to support a Lifshitz metric if one St¨uckelberg couples it to the axion via a flux on the S1 . In doing so, the correct ansatz for the axion is C0(x,ϑ) = C0(x) + n ϑ with n a constant. We should point out that, even if C0 has a explicit linear dependence on the circle coordinate, its axionic nature ensures that it necessarily enters into the action covered by a derivative and thus the circle reduction is consistent. Moreover, in this way one generates a covariant derivative for it and consequently a mass term for the vector with DC0 = dC0 − n A. The second term will enter as a modification to the potential. Assuming that the dilaton depends just on the M4 coordinates the reduction is then straightforward and the resulting action reads where the gravitational constant has been redefined to κ 2 5 = κ 2 4 R S1 dϑ. For our purposes it is more convenient to dualize the axion to a 2-form and work with a system more similar to the one in [6]. Let us add to the action the following piece  where we denoted G1 = DC0. Variation with respect to A2 gives the Bianchi dG1 = −n F as expected, while varying w.r.t. G1 one deduces instead the duality condition G1 = e −2φ ∗ dA2 that once substituted into the action yields Leaving apart the scalars φ and T, this is the form of the action used in [6]. These two modes may seem spurious for the purposes of obtaining Lifshitz solutions, but are unavoidable for consistency of the truncation. Indeed, the scalar T will be present in any model that uses A as a support for the Lifshitz metric, since it is well known that the modulus of a circle cannot be consistently switched off while retaining the vector gauging its isometry. Similarly, we cannot truncate away the dilaton and simultaneously keep the axion. The presence of these fields complicates the analysis of the equations of motion with respect to the phenomenological models of [6, 24]. On the other hand, some new appealing features of our black holes will be caused by these modes, as we will detail. We want to generalize the Lifshitz metric (1.1) above to allow for black hole solutions with z = 2, so we pick2 and k is the curvature corresponding to spherical, flat or hyperbolic horizon, respectively. Since we are interested in geometries that are asymptotically Lifshitz we will impose the boundary conditions f(r), g(r) → 1 as r → ∞. To support this metric we take the following ansatz for the forms (with the obvious choice of vielbeins)  where ′ indicates derivative with respect to the radial coordinate. There are two combinations of Ricci tensor components, namely Rtt + Rrr ± 2 Rψψ, that give first order equations once substituted into Einstein’s equations. They read The third component is not independent and follows from these two. One important point is that, since f ′ ∝ f, we can use (2.17) in the e.o.m. of the matter fields to decouple f from the system. We can then solve for T, ϕ, g, h and j and substitute in the equation for f. We have not found exact black hole solutions of the complete system (2.13)–(2.18).3 It is simple to check that the Lifshitz metric (1.1) with z = 2 and d = 4 verifies the equations above. This amounts to take Therefore, the solutions we are interested in will approach these values asymptotically in the boundary located at r → ∞. Notice that the equations admit no other solution with vanishing scalars and thus there is no limit in which we recover the one-parameter family of black holes found in [24]. Indeed, in our setup the cosmological constant is replaced by a potential and the scalars play an active role in supporting the black hole metrics, increasing the number of free parameters characterizing the solutions. As we will see this deeply influences the thermodynamic properties of the system. 3 The Lifshitz black hole solutions In order to find asymptotically Lifshitz black hole solutions we will resort to numerics. But before integrating the system, let us study the asymptotic behaviour of such solutions. 3.1 Asymptotic behaviour In the UV regime, r → ∞, we are looking for solutions that asymptote to Lifshitz geometry with scaling z = 2, i.e. f, g, h, j → 1 and ϕ, T → 0 near the boundary. Therefore we can linearize the equations of motion around the fixed point and study the subleading behaviour of the fields in the asymptotically large r region. For convenience let us define new scalar fields resulting equations of motion up to linear order in δψ. The most important feature of the linearized system is the presence of a zero mode solution, i.e. independent of the radial coordinate. Of course, coming back to the non-linearized problem, such zero mode develops an r-dependent profile. If one gets close enough to the boundary, the zero mode gives the dominant subleading contribution to the fields, since one expects the other modes to have already decayed. However, even if the zero mode has negative amplitude, its decay will be very slow and so will be the convergence to Lifshitz geometry. 4 For that reason we will seek solutions for which the amplitude of the zero mode vanishes and the decaying modes of the fields behave as 1/r2 and log r/r2 . In particular, the leading orders of the solutions to the non-linearized system in the UV, imposing Lifshitz asymptotics and a vanishing amplitude for the zero mode, are given by where α and β are arbitrary constants and the dots represent terms that decay faster than 1/r2 . In the deep IR we want the above solutions to flow to a black hole like geometry. A non-extremal black hole is characterized by the presence of a non-degenerate horizon at a finite r = rH. In our coordinates, this implies that the gtt component of the metric has a simple zero at this point, whereas the grr component has a simple pole there. Regularity of the solution further demands that the 2-form field strength j(r) vanishes at the horizon as ∼ 1/g(r). We will assume that the vector field strength and the scalar fields have a finite value at the horizon. Under these considerations, the near-horizon expansion of the fields takes the form  3.2 Numerical integration Now we can proceed to the numerical integration of the system. We use the near-horizon expansions in (3.3) to generate initial data close to the horizon and then integrate the equations of motion in (2.13)–(2.18) towards the UV demanding that the solution has Lifshitz behaviour at the boundary. Since we have a large number of free parameters the strategy is the following. As we already know, f0 is nothing but a normalization scale for f(r). Therefore we can set f0 = 1 and afterwards rescale with the asymptotic boundary value of the numerical solution, automatically fixing the normalization of f in such a way that f(r) → 1 as r → ∞. We are then left with four parameters, i.e. the horizon radius, the vector field strength and the scalar horizon values. In each integration we keep fixed the black hole size rH and the modulus τ0, while tuning the dilaton γ0 and the 1-form flux h0 in order to get Lifshitz solutions. The precision of our numerical results is |ψ−1| < 10−4 at the cutoff r = 106 , where ψ represents all the fields but f. We then explore the parameter space by repeating the procedure for different pairs of initial data {rH,τ0}. In principle we could have picked any other free parameter rather than τ0 to generate the initial data. However this is a natural choice since the modulus T will be present in any Lifshitz solution based on the massive vector A [14, 17]. In figures 1, 2 and 3 are shown the metric, form and scalar radial profiles of the solutions for two different black hole sizes and each for two different values of the modulus. It is clear that convergence to Lifshitz geometry is better for large values of the scalar τ0 at the horizon. Convergence is also better the larger the black hole for a given τ0. It turns out that γ(r) ≤ 1 for any pair of initial values of the parameters. This implies that the dilaton in the black hole solution is always smaller than in the pure Lifshitz space, i.e. φBH(r) ≤ φLif. On the other hand, the constraint found on the modulus is simply given by τ0 > γ0 > 0 (see figure 4), so the original modulus T(r) can take both positive and negative values in the black hole solution. The peak and dip developed by the metric functions of the black holes close to the horizon grow when the modulus τ0 decreases. From this behaviour and the fact that convergence is worse the smaller is τ0, one could expect that for a given black hole size, there is a minimum value of that scalar field at the horizon for which the field solutions are able to stabilize to their Lifshitz limit when flowing to the UV. In fact this is the case. In figure 4 it is plotted the 1-form flux as a function of γ0/τ0 for fixed values of the horizon radius.6 Very large values of τ0 correspond to the beginning of the curves, where h0 → 0, whereas the ending of the curves corresponds to the minimum value of τ0 for each rH. At this minimum, γ0 is also a minimum, while h0 reaches its maximum value. For the flat black hole solution, k = 0, the limiting configuration corresponds to the maximum value of the ratio of the scalars, γ0/τ0 = 0.8164, and to the minimum value that the scalars can reach. The bounds (3.6) are satisfied along the whole curves. Moreover, the bound for h0 is saturated only in the τ0 → ∞ limit, where h0 → 0. For very large values of the modulus τ0, the γ field is roughly constant, γ(r) . 1, so there is no running of the dilaton with the RG flow, and the horizon 1-form flux almost vanishes. Therefore the black hole is only supported by the modulus T. Notice that this behaviour is independent of the black hole size and that for non-vanishing rH extremality is only achieved in the limit τ0 → ∞, that of course is not a regular solution at the horizon. For regular solutions extremal black holes could appear in the limit of vanishing black hole size. This kind of zero temperature solutions were found in phenomenological models [24, 37]. However, it will not be the case in the stringy model at hand due to the presence of the additional scalars. For a given initial τ0 there is a minimum black hole size that can support the configuration of fluxes that make the solution flow to Lifshitz asymptotics. In figure 5 we show the horizon values γ0 and h0 as a function of rH for fixed values of τ0. For large rH they take the asymptotic values given by the flat solution, k = 0, and both of them remain barely constant in a wide range of rH. When the horizon radius gets close to its minimum size, the dilaton γ0 rapidly decreases to its minimum value, while the flux h0 either grows or decreases depending on the value of τ0. There is a second branch of solutions that is not connected to the flat solution and that merges smoothly with the one described above at the minimum rH. Over this second branch, γ0 decreases and h0 increases while the black hole grows. In principle, we expect γ0 to asymptotically vanish for large black hole radius. Convergence to Lifshitz geometry of these solutions is very poor when one moves further from the minimum size, contrasting with the first branch, where convergence is better the larger the black hole. The second branch will be shown to be thermodynamically unstable. 3.3 Thermodynamics of Lifshitz black holes From the ansatz (2.9) and using the near-horizon expansion (3.3), we can determine various thermodynamical quantities that characterize the black holes. The Hawking temperature both for k = 0, 1, after appropriate volume normalization and where we set the Newton constant to one. The conditions (3.6) have to be satisfied in order to have a positive real temperature. In fact, if the bound for h0 is saturated the black hole becomes extremal. Due to the intrinsic dependence of the horizon values of the fields on the black hole size it is not possible to write the explicit dependence of the entropy density on the temperature. However approximate relations can be found in certain regions of the parameter space. The thermodynamic behaviour of the Lifshitz black holes above can be easily studied. Figure 6 shows the Hawking temperature as a function of the black hole size and the entropy density as a function of the temperature. There are significant differences with previous phenomenological models. As already mentioned, in [24, 37] extremal black holes were found in the limit of vanishing horizon radius since temperature for such models turned out to be a monotonic function of the black hole size. In our string theory model, the presence of additional matter fields prevents the horizon to shrink to rH = 0 and consequently extremality is never reached. Temperature for large black holes increases with the size, while for small black holes it develops a negative slope. Having negative specific heat, these small black holes are always thermodynamically disfavoured. Notice that the concept of smallness is τ0-dependent. This is precisely the behaviour shown by AdS-Schwarzschild black holes. In analogy with this well known case [42], we expect to have a Hawking-Page like phase transition between large Lifshitz black holes at high temperature and ‘thermal’ Lifshitz (pure Lifshitz space with compact Euclidean time) at low temperature. For very large black holes the temperature is approximately TH ∝ r 2 H . Since the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy density is simply given by the area of the horizon, it is possible to write down its temperature dependence in the rH ≫ 1 limit as  Hence, large Lifshitz black holes satisfy the expected scaling behaviour for a field theory with dynamical exponent z = 2 in flat 2 + 1-dimensions, s ∝ T 2/z . In order to ensure that the small black holes and the second branch of solutions are unstable compared to the large ones we can compute the free energy of the system. From the first law of thermodynamics, ǫ + P = sT, and the relation between energy density and pressure for the dual field theory, ǫ = P, the free energy is easily computed as  This thermodynamic relation has been proved to hold by computing the free energy from the Euclidean bulk action in [28, 38, 40, 43] for various phenomenological models.7 Figure 7 shows the free energy as a function of the temperature for various initial values of τ0. For temperatures above the minimum temperature, there exist two different solutions. The lower one, hence the stable, corresponds to large black holes, whereas the upper one is clearly unstable and corresponds both to small black holes and to the second branch of solutions, as expected from previous considerations. For temperatures below the minimum temperature, Lifshitz black holes can not exist and presumably a phase transition to ‘thermal’ Lifshitz will take place. 4 Conclusions In this work we have constructed infinite families of asymptotically Lifshitz black holes in string theory. We made use of a consistent truncation of type IIB supergravity on an arbitrary 5-dimensional Einstein space that keeps the axio-dilaton. By further reducing on a circle we obtain an additional scalar (the modulus of the S1 ) and a vector that is appropriate to support Lifshitz black holes with dynamical exponent z = 2. The model obtained in this way is not minimal, in the sense that previous phenomenological studies were lacking the dilaton and the modulus that are mandatory for the consistency of our truncation. These extra modes contribute in a very non-trivial way to the equations and yield new interesting features. We found no extremal black holes. In phenomenological models [24, 37] the extremal limit corresponds to vanishing black hole horizon, but here we observe a lower bound on the size. On top of that, small black holes turn out to be unstable. For large black holes, temperature increases with the horizon radius, while for small black holes it develops a negative slope, pointing to an instability that we confirmed by computing the free energy. The fact that black holes have a minimum temperature leads us to expect a Hawking-Page like phase transition, resembling the AdS-Schwarzschild case. It would be interesting to know if this behaviour is general in string theory constructions. It may happen that this property is common to solutions based on the vector we kept, that comes always accompanied by the modulus of the circle. This could be checked by using truncations with matter content different from the axio-dilaton, for instance the one based on the T1,1 of [14]. Other suitable truncations should be easy to find [17]. A pressing question is the nature of the expected phase transition. The first step would be to compute the free energy of the thermal Lifshitz space, in order to proof its existence. We must point out that for Lifshitz geometries the gauge/gravity holographic dictionary is underdeveloped, though some progress has been made [44]. This makes involved the identification of the relevant degrees of freedom in each of the phases. In consequence, it might be premature to interpret the phase transition as the analogue of confinementdeconfinement [45] in non-relativistic systems. We hope to come back to these issues in the near future. It is certainly possible to extend our results to charged Lifshitz black holes. When the internal manifold is not only Einstein but admits a Sasakian structure, there is a consistent truncation that includes an additional vector. Switching on this vector introduces a charge density and thus charged black hole solutions similar to Reissner-Nordstr¨om can be obtained. Interestingly, the truncation can be enhanced to include a charged scalar [8, 17, 19]. Lifshitz black hole solutions where this scalar condenses and breaks the Abelian symmetry would be dual to the superfluid phase of a non-relativistic superconductor [29]. 	Abstract: We provide the first black hole solutions with Lifshitz asymptotics found in string theory. These are expected to be dual to models enjoying anisotropic scale invariance with dynamical exponent z = 2 at finite temperature. We employ a consistent truncation of type IIB supergravity to four dimensions with an arbitrary 5-dimensional Einstein manifold times a circle as internal geometry. New interesting features are found that significantly differ from previous results in phenomenological models. In particular, small black holes are shown to be thermodynamically unstable, analogously to the usual AdS-Schwarzschild black holes, and extremality is never reached. This signals a possible Hawking-Page like phase transition at low temperatures.
14	1994	BLACK HOLE SOLUTIONS IN HETEROTIC STRING THEORY ON A TORUS	Ashoke Sen	BLACK HOLE SOLUTIONS IN HETEROTIC STRING THEORY ON A TORUS Abstract We construct the general electrically charged, rotating black hole solution in the heterotic string theory compactified on a six dimensional torus and study its classical properties. This black hole is characterized by its mass, angular momentum, and a 28 dimensional electric charge vector. We recover the axion-dilaton black holes and Kaluza-Klein black holes for special values of the charge vector. For a generic black hole of this kind, the 28 dimensional magnetic dipole moment vector is not proportional to the electric charge vector, and we need two different gyromagnetic ratios for specifying the relation between these two vectors. We also give an algorithm for constructing a 58 parameter rotating dyonic black hole solution in this theory, characterized by its mass, angular momentum, a 28 dimensional electric charge vector and a 28 dimensional magnetic charge vector. This is the most general asymptotically flat black hole solution in this theory consistent with the no-hair theorem.  1 Introduction and Summary There has been a lot of activity in recent years towards construction of black hole solutions in string theory[1]. Since string theory is expected to provide a finite quantum theory of gravity, we hope that within the context of string theory we might be able to address various vexing questions in black hole physics related to the black hole evaporation and the consequent information loss puzzle. One suggestion in this direction has been made in refs.[2, 3]. It has also been proposed there that massive elementary string states themselves should be identified with black holes in string theory. Similar suggestions have also been made in refs.[4, 5, 6] but for different reasons. In order to study the physics of black holes in string theory, we need to first construct the black hole solutions in string theory, and then study their properties. In particular, study of the relationship between black holes and elementary string states requires us to construct the most general electrically charged black hole solution in the theory. In this paper we undertake the task of constructing the most general black hole solution in one particular four dimensional string theory, − the heterotic string theory compactified on a six dimensional torus. There are various reasons for choosing this particular theory. One of them is that due to the existence of an N=4 supersymmetry in this theory, there are various non-renormalization theorems which may make the quantum theory in this case more tractable compared to the other compactification schemes. Second, this is perhaps the best understood four dimensional string theory[7]. And finally, this theory is expected to possess a strong-weak coupling duality symmetry[8] which may make the study of the non-perturbative physics more feasible. The theory under consideration has 28 U(1) gauge fields, and thus one would expect that a generic electrically charged black hole should be labelled by a 28 dimensional charge vector. In section 2 we use the technique of O(d,d+p) transformations[9, 10, 11, 1] to explicitly construct a black hole solution characterized by an arbitrary 28 dimensional charge vector, as well as mass and angular momentum, and study its various properties.1 The relevant transformations in the present case generate the group O(7,23). The final solution is given in eqs.(2.29) - (2.37). For various special values of the parameters we can identify the solution to various known solutions e.g. the rotating charged dilaton black hole of ref.[13] and the rotating Kaluza-Klein black hole of refs.[14, 15]. One novel feature of a generic black hole solution is that the 28 dimensional vector representing its magnetic dipole moment is not, in general, parallel to the 28 dimensional vector representing its electric charge, and we need two gyromagnetic ratios for specifying the relation between these two vectors. Also, a generic black hole solution has all the 132 moduli fields, as well as the dilaton-axion field non-zero. We discuss the extremal limits, both for nonzero angular momentum and zero angular momentum. For non-rotating black holes, some of the extremal black holes saturate the Bogomol’nyi bound and hence have unbroken supersymmetry. But black holes carrying non-zero angular momentum never saturate Bogomol’nyi bound, and hence have no unbroken supersymmetry If we allow the solution to carry magnetic charges also, then it should be characterized by 58 parameters, the mass, the angular momentum, 28 electric charges, and 28 magnetic charges. In section 3 we give an algorithm to construct this 58 parameter rotating dyonic black hole solution. This is done by using a combination of the S-duality transformations[16, 12] belonging to the group SL(2,R) and the O(7,23) transformations[17, 18, 19, 20, 6]. These two transformations together generate the group O(8,24)[21, 22]. This algorithm in fact naturally produces a 59 parameter solution with singular metric, belonging to the Taub-NUT family. We recover the non-singular black hole solutions by imposing one restriction on these 59 parameters, which sets the NUT charge to zero. We conclude the paper in section 4 by pointing out some amusing coincidences between the properties of black holes and those of elementary string states in the extremal limit. 2 Rotating Electrically Charged Black Holes The massless fields in heterotic string theory compactified on a six dimensional torus consist of the metric Gµν , the anti-symmetric tensor field Bµν, twenty eight U(1) gauge fields A(a) µ (1 ≤ a ≤ 28), the scalar dilaton field Φ, and a 28 × 28 matrix valued scalar field M satisfying, Given a solution with any other asymptotically constant field configuration, we can bring it to the form (2.21) by a combination of the O(6,22) transformation, the transformation Φ → Φ + constant, the general coordinate transformation involving linear change in the coordinates, and the freedom of shifting A(a) µ and Bµν by constants. Thus we do not suffer from any loss of generality by restricting to field configurations with asymptotic behaviour given in eq.(2.21).  We can now generate new solutions by performing an O(7,23) transformation on this solution. Since, however, we want to keep the asymptotic forms of various field configurations fixed, we only use a subgroup of the O(7,23) transformations which preserve (2.22). This leaves us with an O(6,1)×O(22,1) subgroup of the full O(7,23) group. If we describe the transformation by the matrix UΩ¯U T instead of Ω, then the O(6,1) subgroup acts on the 23rd - 28th, and ¯ the 30th index of the matrix UMU¯ T , whereas the O(22,1) subgroup acts on the 1st - 22nd, and the 29th index of the matrix UMU¯ T . Not every element of this O(6,1)×O(22,1) subgroup generates a new solution however. It is clear from eq.(2.24) that an O(22)×O(6) subgroup, which acts on the 1st - 22nd and the 23rd - 28th indices respectively, leaves the solution invariant. Thus the transformations which generate inequivalent solutions, preserving the asymptotic field configuration, can be parametrized by the coset From eqs.(2.40) and (2.41) we see that for generic values of the parameters α, β, ~n and ~p, the 28- dimensional vectors ~µ and Q~ are not parallel to each other. The special cases for which ~µ and Q~ are parallel are i) β = 0, ii) α = 0, and iii) α = β. The black hole solution in case (i) corresponds to the rotating charged black hole solution discussed in ref.[13], whereas the case α = β corresponds to the Kaluza-Klein black hole discussed in refs.[14, 15]. To check that the results (2.40) and (2.41) are consistent with the ones derived in refs.[13, 15], note that the gyromagnetic ratio, defined as 2µM/QJ, is equal to 2 in case (i), and is equal to (1 + sech2α) in case (iii), which varies between 1 and 2 as α varies between ∞ and 0. Even though ~µ and Q~ are not parallel in general, and hence we cannot define an overall gyromagnetic ratio, we can define two separate gyromagnetic ratios in the left and the right hand sector as follows. Let us define In the normalization convention that we have been using, the Bogomol’nyi bound that follows from the space-time supersymmetry of the theory, is given by M2 ≥ (Q~ 2 R/2)[24, 25]. Thus we see that the extremal black holes in cases II and III saturate the Bogomol’nyi bound, and hence give rise to supersymmetric solutions, whereas those in case I do not. Also for non-zero J, eqs.(2.38)-(2.40) shows that M2 is always larger than (Q~ 2 R/2), even in the extremal limit a → m. This shows that the extremal black holes carrying non-zero angular momentum do not correspond to supersymmetric solutions. (Similar observations have been made in ref.[26].) For special cases α = β and α = 0, the non-rotating solutions constructed here reproduce the solutions discussed in ref.[5]. 3 Rotating Dyonic Black Holes In this section we shall discuss construction of black holes carrying both electric and magnetic charges. One class of dyons that can be constructed trivially are the ones for which the magnetic charge vector Q~ mag is parallel to LQ~ el, where Q~ el is the electric charge vector. This is done with  the help of SL(2,R) transformations[27, 16, 12, 28]. To see how this works, we first note that the equation of motion for the Bµν field, derived from the action (2.3), allows us to introduce a field Ψ, related to Hµνρ through the relation: of various fields. Let us choose the asymptotic values of Φ and Ψ to be zero. A solution with non-zero asymptotic values of Φ and Ψ can be brought to this form by using the freedom of shifting Φ and Ψ by constants keeping Gµν, A(a) µ and M fixed. Thus we do not suffer from any loss of generality by restricting our solutions this way. This forces us to consider only those SL(2,R) transformations which leave the point Φ = Ψ = 0 fixed. These transformations belong to an SO(2) subgroup of SL(2,R), and are represented by the matrix  a b c d  =  cos γ sin γ − sin γ cos γ  . (3.5) We can now apply this transformation to the electrically charged rotating black hole solution given in eqs.(2.29)-(2.37). Since gµν does not transform under the SL(2,R) transformation, the geometry remains identical. The matrix valued scalar field M also remains the same as given in eqs.(2.35), (2.36). The fields Φ, A(a) µ and Bµν (or equivalently Ψ) change. We shall not write down the transformed solutions explicitly, but only give the asymptotic forms of the gauge field strengths which allow us to extract the electric and the magnetic charges associated with this solution. These are given by, This shows that we have to be careful about applying SL(2,R) and O(7,23) transformations on a solution successively, but it does not rule out the possibility that suitable combinations of these transformations can be found which give rise to a non-singular metric. We shall now show how this can be done in a systematic manner to produce a 58 parameter black hole solution carrying arbitrary mass, angular momentum, electric charge and magnetic charge. The first point to note is that since for time independent solutions the equations of motion of this theory are the same as those of the ten dimensional heterotic string theory for field configurations independent of seven of the ten dimensions (the time and the six internal coordinates), these equations of motion are expected to have an O(8,24) symmetry[21, 22].2 To see how this O(8,24) symmetry manifests itself in the present case, let us first note that the equations of motion of the A¯ (¯a) i fields, derived from the action (2.14) gives, 4 Conclusion In this paper we have explicitly constructed the general electrically charged rotating black hole solution in heterotic string theory compactified on a six dimensional torus. We have also given 17 an algorithm to construct the general rotating black hole solution carrying both, electric and magnetic charges. This is the most general black hole solution in this theory consistent with no hair theorem. We hope that these results can be used to study the relationship between black holes and elementary string states in the spirit of refs.[2, 3]. To this end, we shall conclude this paper by pointing out some amusing coincidences between the properties of black holes and those of elementary strings in the extremal limit. First we compare the gyromagnetic ratios of the solutions found in this paper and those of elementary string states in the limit β → ∞ with the physical mass M, the physical angular momentum J, and the parameter α fixed. Here α and β are the parameters appearing in the black hole solution given in section 2. (Note that in this limit the solution develops naked singularity, but we shall ignore this problem. We can take the limit J → 0 at the end of the calculation, so that the solution approaches an extremal black hole.) From eq.(2.44) we see that in this limit, gL → 0, gNext we shall compare the area of the stretched horizon and the logarithm of the density of single string states in the extremal limit. We shall restrict ourselves to the non-rotating solution since in this case the extremal limit (2.58) corresponds to saturation of the Bogomol’nyi bound, and various non-renormalization theorems are expected to be valid. As we can see from eq.(2.61), the area of the event horizon vanishes in the limit (2.58). However, if As denotes the area of the surface ρ = ρ + H + η, where η is a fixed length of the order of the Planck length, then using eq.(2.52) we find that it is non-zero and has the value where n denotes the total contribution to mass2 of the state from the left moving oscillators. (Note that in this case there is no appreciable contribution to the density of states from the right moving oscillators.) This, in turn, is proportional to M2 − (Q~ 2 L/2). Thus we see that, As ∝ ln dS . (4.5) This establishes the relationship between the density of string states and the area of the stretched horizon in the extremal limit. 	Abstract We construct the general electrically charged, rotating black hole solution in the heterotic string theory compactified on a six dimensional torus and study its classical properties. This black hole is characterized by its mass, angular momentum, and a 28 dimensional electric charge vector. We recover the axion-dilaton black holes and Kaluza-Klein black holes for special values of the charge vector. For a generic black hole of this kind, the 28 dimensional magnetic dipole moment vector is not proportional to the electric charge vector, and we need two different gyromagnetic ratios for specifying the relation between these two vectors. We also give an algorithm for constructing a 58 parameter rotating dyonic black hole solution in this theory, characterized by its mass, angular momentum, a 28 dimensional electric charge vector and a 28 dimensional magnetic charge vector. This is the most general asymptotically flat black hole solution in this theory consistent with the no-hair theorem.

Box 586, 34100 Trieste, Italy (Received 10 May 1988) Spherically symmetric solutions of d-dimensional Einstein-Maxwell theory with a Gauss-Bonnet term are classified. All spherically symmetric solutions of d-dimensional Einstein gravity coupled to the Gauss-Bonnet and Born-Infeld terms are derived, classified, and compared with the previous solutions. Thermodynamic properties of the black holes are discussed and the black-hole temperatures derived. Unlike the solutions of Einstein-Maxwell theory the solutions with a Born-Infeld term do not appear to have a stable end point with regard to thermal evaporation.  I. INTRODUCTION In their low-energy limit string theories give rise to effective models of gravity in higher dimensions which involve higher powers of the Riemann curvature in addition to the usual Einstein term. ' It is hoped that the full low-energy theory will solve the problem of singularities in general relativity. However, in the absence of knowledge of the details of such a theory, attempts have been made to gain further insight by studying models which include only the leading-order corrections, such as the quadratic-order Gauss-Bonnet term. Black holes, wave propagation, ' ' dimensional reduction, ' ' and cosmological models ' ' " have been a particular focus of research. Models involving dimensionally continued Euler densities ' of higher than quadratic order have also been investigated, ' ' ' ' although the relationship between such models and the low-energy limit of string theory has not been established. In any case, higher-dimensional models involving dimensionally continued Euler densities are of independent interest since they allow spontaneous compactification. Two somewhat different, but complementary, approaches have been taken to the study of black holes in string-generated gravity models. One approach ' has been to take black-hole solutions of conventional Einstein theory, and to treat the additional leading-order stringgenerated terms as perturbations about these backgrounds. Such an approach is valid if the curvature is small compared with the scale set by the string tension T=(2sra') '. A second approach has been to study exact solutions of Einstein theory supplemented by a Gauss-Bonnet term. These two approaches are equivalent insofar as they relate to regions in which the first approach is valid. The second approach, by concentrating on exact solutions, accommodates a study of the global properties of solutions. However, this is by no means an advantage as far as string physics is concerned, since in regions of high curvature additional higher-order terms in the slope expansion will become important. The second approach has revealed some interesting properties, such as the existence of a second branch of asymptotically (anti —)de Sitter solutions in addition to the familiar asymptotically fiat branch. If the dilaton is ineluded the asymptotically (anti —)de Sitter branch is excluded; however, the extra branch could persist at the level of higher-order curvature corrections. The exact nature of the effective low-energy theory is naturally of importance. Unfortunately there is as yet no unambiguous way of determining it. One method of obtaining the low-energy theory is to calculate string tree N-point amplitudes with massless external states, and then look for a conventional field-theory action which reproduces these amplitudes at the tree level. However, an ambiguity arises since one can make field redefinitions without changing the S matrix. At quadratic order one obtains terms of the form where o is a real scalar field (the dilaton) and a is a constant of dimension L" related to the slope parameter e'. The coefFicients a and b cannot be uniquely determined because of the field redefinition ambiguity. The effective action may be derived in other ways, in particular by investigation of world-sheet 0. models. ' However, these schemes lead to a similar ambiguity. Some constraints on the coefficients of the higherderivative terms in (1.1) can be made if one requires that the strong slope expansion be ghost-free, as the string itself is. Zwiebach has shown that this is indeed the case if one chooses a =—4 and b =1 (Ref. 35). The resulting combination is the Gauss-Bonnet term which is a topological invariant in four dimensions. The basis of Zwiebach's argument is that if one requires that the graviton propagator near Aat space is not modified by the higher-derivative terms then one is uniquely led to the Gauss-Bonnet combination. It has been pointed out that Zwiebach's criterion is in fact somewhat stronger than mere ghost freedom: one could add an arbitrary amount of E. without introducing ghosts. ' The resulting theory would contain additional massive scalar fields (with positive norm). However, the Gauss-Bonnet term is the only possible combination for which the quadratic-order gravitational action describes a pure massless graviton at the linearized level.In an earlier paper black-hole solutions of ddimensional Einstein-Maxwell theory with a GaussBonnet term were derived. However, if one is to consider an electromagnetic field coupled to a gravitational action which includes string-generated corrections, then it is natural to consider string-generated corrections to the Maxwell action also. Such corrections arise if one considers the coupling of an Abelian gauge field to the open bosonic string ' or the open superstring. In fact, the effective electromagnetic action can be determined exactly at the tree level —a rather better state of affairs than in the case of the gravitational action. It coincides with the nonlinear action of Born and Infeld: where b is a constant of dimension L ",which is related to the slope parameter. [In (1.2) we have ignored the coupling to the dilaton and Kalb-Ramond fields. ] The Born-Infeld Lagrangian coincides with the Maxwell Lagrangian to leading order in 1/b The B.orn-Infeld theory was originally formulated with the aim of describing apparently nonsingular static configurations such as electrons, although it did not have success in this regard. It was later realized that the Born-Infeld action admits nontrivial vortex solutions. Fradkin and Tseytlin have pointed out that since the effective field theory derived from a fundamental string theory may therefore have classical stringlike solutions, there could perhaps be a kind of bootstrapping between the effective and full theories. Another way in which theories involving nonlinear electromagnetic terms can arise is through a KaluzaKlein-type reduction of higher-dimensional theories which include dimensionally continued Euler densities. Muller-Hoissen' " and Kerner' have investigated the reduction of the five-dimensional Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet theory. The resulting dimensionally reduced fourdimensional theory contains nonlinear electromagnetic terms, which do not correspond to the Born-Infeld term, however. In this paper we shall derive solutions of a model which includes the Gauss-Bonnet and Born-Infeld terms. In doing so, we shall neglect the coupling of the dilaton and Kalb-Ramond fields. Our only reason for doing so is that it allows the field equations to be integrated exactly. Before deriving these solutions we shall, for the purpose of comparison, classify the "Schwarzschild" ' and "Reissner-Nordstrom" solutions —namely, the spherically symmetric solutions of the field equations derived from the action as r~~, which corresponds to a Reissner-Nordstrom- (anti —)de Sitter solution with negative gravitational mass, if M &0, and imaginary charge Q. These solutions are asymptotically anti —de Sitter if a & 0 (or de Sitter if a (0). The Schwarzschild- and Reissner-Nordstrom-type solutions are classified in Secs. II and III. In Sec. IV the solutions of the model including the Born-Infeld and Gauss-Bonnet terms are derived and classified. In Sec. V the thermodynamics of the black holes are discussed. Some concluding remarks are made in Sec. VI. CHWARZSCHILD-TYPE SOLUTIONS The global properties of the solutions (1.4) may be readily determined. We shall assume that d & 6 since the properties of the solutions may differ slightly in the special case d =5. If Q =0 the structure of the singularities and horizons may be summarized as follows. (1) Asymptotically f?at branch. (a) If M & 0 and a & 0, or if M =0 and a &0, then there is a singularity at the origin. The singularity is shielded by a regular horizon which is located at r+, where rd~—3+4~2 ar~d —s —2GM =0 . (2.1) The spacetime thus has the global properties of the Schwarzschild solution. One may define Kruskal coordinates in the usual fashion to eliminate the apparent singularity at r =re (Ref 3).. The value of r+ is always less than that of the a=0 case. (b) If M & 0 and ao & a &0, where is given by (2.3). If M &0 and a &0, or M =0 and a &0, then the singularity is located at the origin. (2) Asymptotically (anti )d—e Sitter branch (.a) If M &0 and a ga&, where 4a (d —4)(d —5)ai ———~ (d —5)GM ~ (2.4) III. CLASSIFICATION OF THE REISSNER-NORDSTROM-TYPE SOLUTIONS then there is a singularity at the origin which is shielded by two horizons. The horizons are given by solutions of (2.1). In the limiting case a=a, there is a single degenerate horizon. (b) If M &0 and a&ao, then there is a timelike singularity at r =ro, shielded by a horizon at r =r&. (c) In the remaining cases there is a naked singularity. If M &0 and a&0, or if M &0 and ao(a&0, then the singularity is located at r =ro. If M &0 and a&0, or if M &0 and ai &a&0, then the singularity is located at the origin.  d —1 which is shielded by a horizon at r =r&. The spacetime once again has the properties of the Schwarzschild solution. The value of r& is always greater than that of the a=O case. (c) In the remaining cases there is a naked timelike singularity. If M &0 and a & 0, or if M &0 and a(ao, then the singularity is located at r =ro, where ro In each dis.tinct case one can determine the number of turning points of f(r), and hence the number of possible zeros, since f(r) is continuous on any domain on which A(r) is defined. In fact, f(r) has a maximum of two zeros in any particular case. Furthermore, if r+ denotes a solution of (3.3) then it will correspond to a horizon of the upper branch if I+8m a/r~ & 0, or a horizon of the lower branch if 1+Sv a/r ~ 0. If ner and outer horizons of the usual arbitrary dimensional Reissner-Nordstrom solution, Q being given by —2 2Q (d —2)(d —3) (3.3c) The structure of the horizons and singularities may be determined by a careful analysis of the functions a (r) and The various cases can be summarized as follows (for d &6). (l) Asymptotically f?at branch (a) If M &0 and. a&0 then there will be a timelike singularity at r =ro, which is shielded by two horizons if Q &Q,„, where Q,„ is the critical value determined by 6 ~, =(db, /dr) ~ „=0,i.e., it is the solution of the equation  If Q =Q,„ there is a single degenerate horizon at r =r,„. The spacetime therefore has the global properties of the nonextreme Reissner-Nordstrom solution if Q & Q,„, and of the extreme Reissner-Nordstrom solution if Q =Q,„. If Q & Q,„the singularity is naked. (b) If M &0 and a&0 there is a naked timelike singularity at r =ro. (c) If M gO and ap&Q &0, or if M &0 and a &0, then there is a singularity at r =0. This singularity will be shielded by two horizons (or a single degenerate horizon in the extreme case} if (i) (3.3) has solutions r+, 0 & r & r+, and (ii) M & 0, Q & 2a. M, and r+ & r, +. The resulting spacetime will therefore have the properties of the Reissner-Nordstrom or extreme Reissner-Nordstrom solution. In the cases excluded by (i) and (ii) the singularity will be naked. (d) If M &0 and a &ao then (3.1) has two solutions: the rp+ l'p & fp+ ~ For an observer in the asymptotic region of the spacetime it is only the location of the outer singularity which is important. (The theory is undefined for ro & r & ro+.) For M & 0 and a & ao any turning point of 5 must lie at a value of r less then rp+. Consequently it is not possible for the outer singularity to be shielded by two horizons in this case. Thus the singularity is timelike and naked if 1+8@ cz/rp+ )0, i.e., if T & fp+ & 1 + ~ If I'p+ )f, +, then the singularity is spacelike and shielded by a horizon. In the second case we have a Schwarzschild-type spacetime. (2) Asymptotically (anti )de S—itter branch. (a) If a&0 then there is a naked branch singularity at r =ra. (b) If M &0 and ap& a &0, or if M &0 and a &0, then there is a singularity at r =0. This singularity will be shielded by two horizons (or a single degenerate horizon in the extreme case) if (i) (3.3) has solutions r+, 0&r &r+, and (ii) M&0, or M &0 and Q &2@ M, or M &0, Q & 2a M and r & r, +. In the cases excluded by (i) and (ii) the singularity will be naked. (c) If M &0 and a &ao then there are branch singularities at r =rp+. The outer singularity is timelike and shielded by a horizon if r, &rp+ &r, +. If rp+ &r, + then we have a naked (spacelike) singularity. IV. SPHERICALLY SYMMETRIC SOLUTIONS WITH A BORN-INFELD TERM We will now turn our attention to the action null there exist Robinson-Bertotti-type solutions, i.e., solutions with the topology (AdS}2&&S . These solutions are derived in the Appendix, both directly from the field equations and also by a limiting procedure from the extreme black holes. We have thus generalized Birkhoff's theorem to the model with Born-Infeld and GaussBonnet terms: the only spherically symmetric solutions are the static solutions (4.13) and (Al) and (A3). The solutions (4.13) and (4.14) are a straightforward generalization of the four-dimensional solution found by Demianski. If d =4 one may perform the integration in (4. 14) exactly and express b, in terms of elliptic functions, but this is not possible in general. The standard Reissner-Nordstrom solution is obtained from (4. 14) in the limit I/b~O. Demianski has claimed that (for d =4) the solution given by (4.13a) and (4.14) is regular ev'erywhere if M =0. This claim is incorrect, however, since near r =0 the invariant  d r~ & r~+. The global properties of the spacetimes are in general somewhat different from the corresponding cases in the last section. The distinct cases may be summarized as follows (for d & 6). (I) Asymptotically Pat branch. (a) If M)0 and a)0 then there is singularity at the origin which is shielded by a regular horizon at r =r~. The spacetime therefore has the global properties of the Schwarzschild solution. (b) If M & 0 and a g 0 then there is a timelike branch singularity at r =ra, which is shielded by two horizons if Q & Q,„, where Q,„ is the critical value such that =(dhldr) ~ „=0,i.e., (4.18) has solutions r, +, 0&r, &r, +, and r+ & r, +. In the cases excluded by (i) and (ii) the singularity will be naked. The case with M )0, a & 0 and the asymptotically flat branch is presumably of most physical interest. (Boulware and Deser have argued that the asymptotically anti —de Sitter branch is unstable, and this should also be the case here. ) The properties of the asymptotically flat branch are summarized in Table I for the three models we have considered. The most important difference between the models with Born-Infeld and Maxwell terms is that in the BornInfeld case the spacetime has the global properties of the Schwarzschild solution rather than the ReissnerNordstrom solution (if M &0 and a &0). In the case of the ordinary Reissner-Nordstrom solution the charge Q is a "central charge" in the sense of supersymmetry and the inequality Q & 2n(d —2)(d.—3)a. M is a Bogomolny-type inequality which is saturated in the case when the supersymmetric extension of the theory admits a Killing spinor. ' The same could well be true of the Reissner-Nordstrom-type solution of the EinsteinMaxwell theory with a Gauss-Bonnet term (if a supersymmetric extension exists). However, for the model with a Born-Infeld term a Schwarzschild-type spacetime is obtained for all values of Q and b, so there is no similar Bogomolny-type bound. Consequently one would expect the physics of the two models to be rather different. This is indeed the case, as we shall see in the next section. violated by the energy-momentum tensor of the GaussBonnet term. If a full set of laws of black-hole mechanics can be derived for the present theory it would require quite a considerable modification of the usual arguments —perhaps through replacing the dominant energy condition by some weaker condition, such as positivity of energy. For the present models the surface gravity is constant on the event horizon, as a consequence of spherical symmetry, and thus a black-hole temperature can be defined. We will evaluate the temperature of the asymptotically flat solutions of Secs. II—IV, and use the results to give qualitative arguments about the evaporation of the holes through Hawking radiation. The temperature of the black holes may be determined in each case by noting that if one analytically continues the metric to imaginary time, t ~i~, then the resulting manifold is regular if ~ is identified with period dA 13=4m. dp' p ~ Since the coordinate ~ is periodic the analytically continued Hartle-Hawking propagator has all the properties V. BLACK-HOLE THERMODYNAMICS It is by now well established that there is a close link between event horizons and thermodynamics in conventional black-hole physics. The question of how thermodynamic properties are altered by the presence of stringgenerated terms is of natural importance. It is not straightforward to derive the "laws of black-hole mechanics, " since in the usual case the dominant energy condition is needed in the proofs. This condition is as can be seen from Fig. 1. However, the temperature becomes arbitrarily large as M ~0, just as in the a=0 case. This should be contrasted with the results of Callan, Myers, and Perry and Myers, who determined the temperature for Schwarzschild-type solutions is a model containing the dilaton plus curvature-squared string correc The isotherms for the a=0 solution in the ~ Q ~ /a vs M plane are displayed in Fig. 2(a). The pattern is the same as in the four-dimensional case. For fixed Q the temperature is a maximum when ~ Q ~ =irM&21 —5/(d —2). This is because the specific heat is negative for ~ Q ~ gNM&2d —5/(d —2) but positive for ~ Q ~ &i~M&2d —5/(d —2). For fixed Q and M the value of T for finite a ( & 0) is lower than in the a =0 case. The temperature has the same qualitative features as that of the usual Reissner-Nordstrom solution, as may be seen by comparing Fig. 2(a) with Fig. 2(b). The curve on which the specific heat changes sign is now a rather complex function of a, Q, and M. As in the a=0 case the extreme black holes have zero temperature. In the case of the model with Gauss-Bonnet and Born-Infeld terms the temperature is given by where rz is a solution of (4.17). The isotherms are sketched in Fig. 3 for o, =O and a & 0. They resemble the isotherms of the Reissner-Nordstrom-type solution, insofar as for fixed ~ Q ~, and decreasing M, the temperature increases to a maximum and then decreases. The fact that the specific heat changes sign is not apparent from Fig. 3(a). However, this is merely due to the scale used in the graph —the specific heat changes sign very close to the M =0 axis, as can be verified numerically. If a&0 then for fixed Q and b the specific heat changes sign at a greater value of M than in the u=O case. The curve on which the specific heat changes sign is in general a rather complex function of M, Q, a, and b . In other respects Figs. 2 and 3 are rather different, however. For M & 0 and a )0 the Born-Infeld model has no configuration corresponding to the extreme black holes, and in fact the M =0 solutions with Q &0 have a finite temperature. This could have interesting physical consequences in connection with the evaporation of the black holes. The qualitative evolution of an evaporating black hole in the ~ Q ~ /~ vs M plot depends largely on whether the elementary fields carry the charge Q. If they do then the hole will lose charge through preferential emission of particles with charge of the same sign, provided that ~ e4~ ~ & M, where e and m are the charge and mass of the elementary field and 4 is the electrostatic potential of the horizon. In such a case the path of an evaporating black hole would be towards the origin of the Q/ir vs M plot, at which point the black-hole temperature diverges and strong quantum effects become important. On the other hand, if the elementary fields do not carry the charge then the path of an evaporating hole will be horizontal in the Q/a vs M plot. This is certainly the case for the ordinary Reissner-Nordstrom solution in four dimensions, for which the charge Q is a "central charge" in the context of N =2 supergravity, i.e., it appears as the commutator of supercharges. ' In that case the end point of thermal evaporation would be the zero-temperature extreme black hole. Similar remarks could well apply to d-dimensional Einstein-Maxwell theory with (or without) a Gauss-Bonnet term, since there is an extreme configuration with zero temperature in all cases. VI. CONCLUSION We have classified the spherically symmetric exact solutions of various string-generated gravity models in d dimensions, and have discussed their thermodynamic properties. These properties are similar to those of corresponding models in four dimensions. The model with a Born-Infeld term seems to offer the unusual possibility that the black-hole mass may become negative as a result of thermal evaporation. The thermodynamic properties of the solutions investigated here differ considerably from the models of Refs. 6 and 7, which included a dilaton field. It is quite possible that addition of the dilaton to the model with the Born-Infeld term could eliminate the possibility of "catastrophic evaporation" discussed above. One important remaining problem is the investigation of the classical stability of the spacetirnes we have classified. Boulware and Deser have argued that the asymptotically anti —de Sitter branch (with M & 0, a & 0) is unstable. Ideally this should be checked by performing an analysis of the type used by Regge and Wheeler. In practice such an analysis is hampered by the fact that the perturbation equations are extremely complex: if one	Spherically symmetric solutions of d-dimensional Einstein-Maxwell theory with a Gauss-Bonnet term are classified. All spherically symmetric solutions of d-dimensional Einstein gravity coupled to the Gauss-Bonnet and Born-Infeld terms are derived, classified, and compared with the previous solutions. Thermodynamic properties of the black holes are discussed and the black-hole temperatures derived. Unlike the solutions of Einstein-Maxwell theory the solutions with a Born-Infeld term do not appear to have a stable end point with regard to thermal evaporation.
16	1998	Near Horizon Geometry of Rotating Black Holes in Five Dimensions	Mirjam Cvetiˇc and Finn Larsen	Near Horizon Geometry of Rotating Black Holes in Five Dimensions Abstract We interpret the general rotating black holes in five dimensions as rotating black strings in six dimensions. In the near horizon limit the geometry is locally AdS 3 × S 3, as in the nonrotating case. However, the global structure couples the AdS 3 and the S 3, giving angular velocity to the S 3. The asymptotic geometry is exploited to count the microstates and recover the precise value of the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy, with rotation taken properly into account. We discuss the perturbation spectrum of the rotating black hole, and its relation to the underlying conformal field theory. 1 Introduction In the last few years there has been substantial progress in the quantum description of black holes in string theory. (For reviews of this development see e.g. [1, 2].). However, string theory has not yet offered decisive progress on the notorious questions concerning the information flow in the black hole spacetime, and the physical nature of its singularity. The reason is that, in critical string theory, the internal structure of black holes is represented by world-volume field theories that are decoupled from gravity, and in this description the role of spacetime geometry is unclear. However, it has recently been proposed that the world-volume description is in fact equivalent to string theory in the curved background of the black hole [3, 4, 5]. The defining examples of this correspondance employ geometries that are products of spaces with constant curvature, with one factor being the Anti-deSitter spacetime (AdS). In these cases the world-volume theory is a conformal field theory (CFT), and the proposal 1 can be justified in explicit computations. Even so, it is not yet clear whether these novel dualities will shed light on the black hole problems alluded to above, but this possibility is an important motivation for their further development. A significant application of the correspondance between conformal field theory and the geometry of AdS spaces is the counting of microstates [6, 7] of the three dimensional black hole of Banados, Teitelboim, and Zanelli (BTZ) [8, 9]. The new microscopic derivation of the black hole entropy follows from little more than the fact that the BTZ geometry is asymptotically AdS3, lending a surprising robustness to the result. This feature of the computation appears to be an important advance over the earlier work of Carlip [10]. Additionally, it is notable that the near horizon geometry of the D1-D5 bound state is of the form BTZ × S3 [11], allowing application of the new method to this case [6]. This has lead to a close connection with previous work on D-brane black holes [12, 13]. The near horizon geometry of three orthogonally intersecting M5-branes in M-theory is similarly BTZ × S2, and this gives a simple relation to previous work on four dimensional black holes [14]. The purpose of the present paper is to investigate this construction in the context of rotating brane configurations. Our starting point is the most general class of black holes in five dimensions [15]. We find the exact form of the corresponding sixdimensional black strings, and then take the decoupling limit. The resulting near horizon geometry describes near extremal black holes and is again of the factorized form BTZ × S3. Interestingly, this is explicit only in a coordinate system that is rotating at the same rate as the black hole. The parameters of the geometry gives the central charge of the effective conformal field theory, as well as the levels of the black hole states. A microscopic entropy can be inferred from these, and the result agrees precisely with the area law. The result takes into account the precise dependence of the two angular momenta. Black hole entropy is discussed in sec. 2. A central result of the CFT/AdS correspondence is the relation between the spectrum of perturbations in the AdS3 × S3 geometry, and the elementary excitations in the worldvolume theory of the D1 − D5 system [12, 13, 16]. The rotating black hole background is also locally AdS3 × S3 so the spectrum is identical in the two cases, but in the black hole background it is natural to discuss the perturbations in terms of greybody factors. In this way the interpretation of perturbations depends on the boundary conditions, and thus on global issues. Specifically, when rotation is included, the coordinates on the sphere S3 depend on the AdS3 coordinates; and this “twisting” of the sphere affects the greybody factors in a universal manner. The perturbations of the black hole are discussed in sec. 3, and the relation between the D1 − D5 system and the black hole is the topic of the concluding remarks in sec. 4. The BTZ background is locally AdS3 and so it exhibits an SL(2,IR)L×SL(2,IR)R symmetry. A preferred set of coordinates can be defined that makes the factorized form of the symmetry manifest. These coordinates provide a spacetime interpretation of the effective string world-sheet. In this concrete realization the temporal and spatial world-sheet coordinates are naturally associated with the outer and inner horizons, respectively. This connection, discussed in sec. 3.4, may have universal significance. There is a generalization of the present work to the case of four dimensional rotating black holes and their representations as rotating strings in five dimensions. 2 This will be discussed in a separate note [17]. The paper is organized in two parts. In the first part, sec. 2, we focus on the black hole entropy: successive subsections give the metric of the general rotating black string in six dimensions, find the decoupling limit and calculate the entropy. In subsec. 2.4 we give the translation between macroscopic black hole parameters and the microscopic quantum numbers. In the second part, sec. 3, we discuss black hole perturbations. The emphasis is on the effects of rotation, but we also make general remarks. We exhibit the local symmetries and recover the near-horizon wave equation for a minimally coupled scalar field in the rotating background. Finally, in sec. 4, we conclude with a discussion of the relation between the conformal field theory induced by the near horizon geometry of the D1 − D5 system and that of the black hole. 2 Black Hole Entropy In this section we present the general form of the rotating black string in six dimensions. We then take the decoupling limit and calculate the microscopic entropy of rotating black holes in five dimensions, following Strominger [6]. 2.1 The Classical Background Consider the most general rotating black holes in N = 4 or N = 8 supergravity in five dimensions [15]. The generating solution for these configurations is given in terms its mass M, 2 angular momenta JL,R, and 3 independent U(1) charges Qi . It is convenient to represent these physical parameters in the parametric form: We work in Planck units where the gravitational coupling constant in five dimensions is G5 = π 4 . The relation to conventional string units is given below, in sec. 2.4. For the present purpose it is essential that the five dimensional black holes can be interpreted as rotating black strings in six dimensions. The six-dimensional geometry can be determined from the five dimensional form of the metric and the matter fields, given in [15]. In Einstein frame the result is 1 : This symmetry expresses an automorphism of the algebra of rotations SO(4) ≃ SU(2)R × SU(2)L that corresponds geometrically to a reflection. The black string metric eq. 4 depends on the parameter δ0 through the boosted differentials dt˜ and dy˜ only, thus signifying a momentum along the string. This property is by no means manifest in the five dimensional form of the metric given in [15]; and so it serves as an important check on the algebra that we recover the boost invariance in our solution. The two charges Q1 and Q2 appear symmetrically in the black string metric, due to duality of the effective six-dimensional theory. They can be interpreted as the charges of a fundamental string (FS) wrapped around the y-direction and a NS5-brane wrapped around both the y-direction and the additional four compact dimensions. The matter fields that are needed for this interpretation were given in [15]. Since duality transformations act on the matter fields, but not on the Einstein metric, we can equally well interpret the metric as the field created by any brane configuration that is dual to the pair NS5-FS. Specifically the U(1) charges can be interpreted as D1- and D5-brane charges. The advantage of this interpretation is that, unlike the NS5-brane, the D-branes are accessible to a weakly coupled microscopic description. For this reason the D-brane interpretation of the solution is in fact mandatory for the decoupling limit taken below.  2.2 The Near Horizon Geometry In some circumstances the internal structure of a black hole is described accurately by a field theory that couples weakly to the surrounding space. A precise definition of the decoupling limit is given by taking [3]: remain fixed. The decoupling limit is a near horizon approximation, because r → 0. Moreover, the “dilute gas” conditions δ1,2 → ∞ imply that the black hole is necessarily near extremal [19]. The metric simplifies dramatically in the limit specified by eq. 10. Note, however, that the function fD does not simplify in this limit, and other features due to rotation are similarly retained. The near horizon geometry is:with fixed Q0 = m sinh 2δ0. In this limit one of the angular momenta JR → 0, but the other JL remains finite. It has previously been found that, in the near horizon region, the extremal rotating black hole preserves 1/4 of the maximal supersymmetry, twice the amount that is preserved in the bulk [20]. Now this result follows from the much simpler analysis of supersymmetry in the context of BTZ black holes [21]. Additionally, it follows that the near-horizon region exhibits superconformal invariance [22], except for a global obstruction that can be removed by decompactification of the 6th dimension. 2.3 Counting States In this section we count the microscopic states of the black hole, following [6]. The effective gravitational coupling in three dimensions G3 can be related to the gravitational coupling in five dimensions G5 by comparing two different dimensional reductions from six dimensions, as in [6, 14]. It is:  Note that the central charge is also independent of angular momentum. This suggests that the rotating black holes can be interpreted as states in the same conformal field theory that describes the nonrotating black holes. The relation between the symmetry generators of the induced conformal symmetry, and the effective mass and angular momentum are: Thus the microscopic entropy eq. 31 precisely reproduces the macroscopic entropy eq. 32, in the decoupling limit eq. 10 where the microscopic calculation applies. The range of parameters that are considered here is as general as the previous D-brane results [25]. Cardy’s formula eq. 29 can be derived from unitarity and modular invariance of the boundary conformal field theory. In the present context unitarity cannot be taken for granted; superconformal WZW-models with the noncompact target space SL(2,IR) are in fact nonunitary. Thus the justification of the calculation ultimately rests on the existence of an underlying unitary framework, such as the one realized in the full string theory. Despite these caveats, we find it impressive that the method accurately reproduces an entropy with the complexity apparent in eq. 33. 2.4 Quantization Conditions It is instructive to rewrite some of the formulae in microscopic units. Then:  where the Ri are the radii of the compact dimensions and the type IIB string coupling g is normalized so that g → 1/g under S-duality. Our convention hitherto was G5 = π 4 , except where G5 is written explicitly. The quantization conditions on the D-brane charges are [26]: that the natural spacing of the conformal weights is in multiples of 1/n1n2. Periodicity around the y-direction would imply that the momentum quantum number p is integral, but in fact p is also quantized in multiples of 1/n1n2. Although this fractionation is suggested by the classical geometry [30, 31, 32], it is most convincingly seen using D-branes [33]. In this way the presence of angular momentum makes a qualitatively important effect more apparent. 3 Black Hole Perturbations The isometry group SO(2, 2) ≃ SL(2,IR)L × SL(2,IR)R of AdS3 can be exploited in several ways. The computation of the entropy relies on the fact that the BTZ black hole is asymptotically AdS3, so that a conformal field theory is induced at the boundary at infinity. However, the BTZ geometry is in fact locally AdS3. This has important consequences for the spectrum of black hole perturbations, and for the dynamics encoded in the greybody factors. In the present section we discuss these issues with emphasis on the effects of rotation. 3.1 The Local AdS3 × S3 We first make the local AdS3 manifest. The near horizon metric eq. 12 defines a quadratic form that can be diagonalized and written as: In this form it is manifest that the geometry is locally AdS3 ×S3 outside the horizon. The result also holds inside the horizon, as can be shown using alternative definitions of the radial coordinate ρ that apply in different patches. Since the local geometry is just AdS3 ×S3, the origin of nontrivial causal structure is of purely global nature [36]. The rotation similarly does not affect the local structure, but the shifts of the angular coordinates eqs. 13–14 tie the S3 to the AdS3. We explore their precise effect in more detail in the following. 3.2 Black Hole Perturbations An important consequence of the local AdS3 × S3 form of the metric is that the spectrum of black hole perturbations is organized into multiplets of the superconformal algebra. This allows a complete classification of all perturbations, as carried out in [16]. The spectrum of perturbations follows from local properties of AdS3, and so it is identical for the entire class of black holes considered here. In the present context the perturbations are naturally interpreted as test fields that interact with the black hole background. The wave function of the perturbations then gives the greybody factor, expressing the form factor of the Hawking radiation as function of particle quantum numbers, such as energy and spin, and of the black hole parameters [19, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41]2 . The greybody factors provide a semiclassical testing ground for dynamical properties. In the special case of minimally coupled scalars in the S-wave they agree precisely with calculations in string theory [45]. The microscopic processes responsible for other modes can be modelled in terms of an effective string theory with dynamics that reproduces the black hole greybody factors qualitatively [37, 38]. It is the local AdS3 × S3 geometry of the near horizon that makes the effective string description possible. Moreover, this connection has made it feasible to complete the list of conformal dimensions that was previously known only in part [16]. The most general black hole depends on 6 parameters (given in eq. 3), but only 4 parameters remain in the decoupling limit specified in eq. 10. They can be chosen as ml−4 s , δ0, l1,2l −2 s , or M, Q0, JL,R, but for the present purpose it is more convenient to choose them as the potentials: The β L,R are conjugate to the left and right moving energy along the string, respectively; and the βH Ω L,R are conjugate to the two independent angular momenta JL,R. The rotating background breaks the rotational invariance so the wave function depends nontrivially on the azimuthal quantum numbers mL,R. However, the rotational invariance is restored in the shifted coordinates eqs. 13-14:  3.3 The Scalar Wave Equation Let us make this discussion explicit in the case of a minimally coupled scalar field. We use the original coordinates t, y and the radial variable x, introduced in eq. 47. Then metric is: were denoted Λ and take the form Λ = l(l + 2) where l = 0, 1, · · ·. The wave equation eq. 56 agrees with the near horizon limit of the general one given in [29], except that there the ansatz for the wave function did not allow dependence on the compact coordinate y 3 . The present generalization gives an even more symmetric result. It is immidiately apparent from the form of the wave equation that its solutions depend on mL,R and βHΩ L,R only through the prescriptions eq. 53. The solution to the near horizon wave equation is a hypergeometric function found in [38, 46, 47] (present notation is used in [29]). The recent work on black hole greybody factors has focussed on massless fields, but here a mass µ is included in the Klein-Gordon equation, eq. 55. This leads to a constant on the right hand side of the radial equation eq. 56 and so the effect of the mass can be absorbed in the conformal dimension. The reason that the mass term does not change the form of the radial equation is that the determinant of the metric is independent of the radial variable. This property is nontrivial: for example, massive fields that couple to the Einstein metric in five dimensions experience a potential induced by the effective dilaton. These fields are therefore more complicated than their six dimensional analogues considered here. It is possible that this observation points towards a simple spacetime description of string states that are massive from the six-dimensional point of view. In rotating backgrounds there are not in general enough isometries to guarantee that the variables can be separated 4 . It is therefore a surprise that this is possible for massless minimally coupled scalars in the five dimensional black hole geometry [29]. The statements made in the preceding paragraph can be verified even for the general nonextremal metric eq. 4. Thus we find that separation of variables remains true for massive scalars, when the mass is measured by the Einstein metric in six dimensions. These properties are precisely analogous to those of Kerr black holes in four dimensions. This is encouraging for the hope that the rotating black holes in string theory admit conserved Killing-Stackel tensors and Killing-Yano spinors that are analogous to those of the Kerr black hole (for some discussion and references see [48, 49]). The generators L~ of the SL(2,IR)L are found by taking σ → −σ. They commute with the R~ . The effect of rotation is taken into account by evaluating the derivatives at fixed value of (ψ, ˜ φ˜). The (τ, σ) are the coordinates that are acted on in a simple way by the local SL(2,IR)L × SL(2,IR)R. It is therefore natural to interpret these variables as the spacetime realizations of the effective string world-sheet coordinates. The τ and the σ are proportional to the t and y, respectively, for a static string wrapped around the y direction. When the string has a momentum along y the world-sheet coordinates the (τ, σ) are proportional to the boosted coordinates t˜and ˜y. However, in the case of a rotating string there is no obvious geometrical interpretation of the linear relation eq. 46 between (τ, σ) and (t, y). There is a striking relation between (τ, σ) and the black hole horizons. In the metric eq. 54 we see that gττ vanishes precisely once, at the outer horizon, and gσσ similarly vanishes once, at the inner horizon. Thus, upon embedding into one dimension higher, the two well known zeros of the gtt, at the two horizons, have been split symmetrically between the remaining time-like, and the additional space-like coordinate. This structure is reflected in the wave equation eq. 56 by the presence of simple poles at both horizons, with an apparent symmetry between their coefficients. The wave equation implies that the potentials conjugate to L- and R- moving energy βL,R, given in eq. 49, are related to the surface accelerations κ± at the outer and inner horizons, respectively, as [29]: 4 Discussion In string theory black holes are described as quantum states that are constructed by exciting a fundamental ground state [27]. A given black hole is described by a projection on the highly excited states that are consistent with the specified left moving (L) and right moving (R) energy and the (L and R) angular momenta. The projected theory forms a legitimate CFT but it is only its finite excitations that can be considered, or else the state belongs to a sector that is better described in terms of different projection. Thus the four parameters that describe the projections act as moduli. On the spacetime side of the AdS/CFT correspondance the fundamental ground state is identified with the AdS3 geometry of the M = −1 BTZ black hole [21, 6], and the excitations are general multiparticle states in the Fock space, constructed over the perturbative spectrum of the AdS3 × S3 [3, 12, 13]. The present paper, and the works on greybody factors, considered the actual black hole spacetime, rather than the vacuum geometry. The geometry remains locally AdS3 × S3 in the black hole spacetime, just as in the vacuum, so the induced CFTs have the same spectrum in the two cases. However, they are not equivalent: the boundary conditions satisfied by the wave functions that describe the perturbations are in one–to–one correspondance with the parameters that describe the black hole, and thus with the moduli of the effective string. The “fundamental” CFT is just a specific point in moduli space, albeit one that defines the vanishing of entropy. It is inherent to this discussion that the black hole microstates are “made out of” excitations of a different background that is not itself a black hole. Thus it is not 	Abstract We interpret the general rotating black holes in five dimensions as rotating black strings in six dimensions.

17	2007	Higher-order corrections to mass-charge relation of extremal black holes	Yevgeny Kats, Luboˇs Motl and Megha Padi	Higher-order corrections to mass-charge relation of extremal black holes Abstract: We investigate the hypothesis that the higher-derivative corrections always make extremal non-supersymmetric black holes lighter than the classical bound and self-repulsive. This hypothesis was recently formulated in the context of the socalled swampland program. One of our examples involves an extremal heterotic black hole in four dimensions. We also calculate the effect of general four-derivative terms in Maxwell-Einstein theories in D dimensions. The results are consistent with the conjecture.1. Introduction In view of the seemingly large number of allowed vacua in string theory, it is important to look for universal properties of these solutions, and see what features of the lowenergy field theory can nevertheless be deduced from string theory. It turns out that such features exist, and not any low-energy particle content is allowed: Vafa [1] has discussed the possibility of restrictions related to the finiteness of volume of massless scalar fields, the finiteness of the number of massless fields, and the rank of the gauge groups. In fact, just the requirement to include quantum gravity (even if not in the framework of string theory) puts constraints on the low-energy physics [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11]. Arkani-Hamed et al. [2] considered a theory of a single U(1) gauge field, and came to the conclusion that the gauge force must be stronger than gravity, i.e., there must exist charged particles for which the net force is repulsive. Furthermore, the effective theory breaks down at some scale beneath the Planck scale, and there should exist a charged particle at or below that scale. In particular, Arkani-Hamed et al. made a prediction regarding the mass-charge relation of extremal black holes. Consider a particle with a mass M and a charge Q. For this particle to be unstable, it must be able to decay into two or more particles whose total mass is smaller than M and total charge equal to Q. To satisfy these conditions, at least one of the outgoing particles must have a smaller M/Q ratio than the original particle. The argument extends to black holes, which are believed to be the low-energy description of elementary particles whose masses are much above the Planck scale. Since it is unnatural to have an infinite number of exactly stable particles, the masscharge relation for extremal black holes M = Q cannot be exact: the M/Q ratio for extremal black holes should decrease with decreasing Q, so that for every extremal black hole there is another black hole with a smaller M/Q ratio (see figure 1). Because states with M/Q < 1 must exist, the most natural expectation is that the black holes, states with very high values of M, Q, also satisfy M/Q < 1, although the difference from 1 is tiny.Since the net force between black holes with M = Q vanishes, the previous argument also predicts that the net force will become repulsive. This is indeed expected because if the force were attractive, heavier bound states with a lower M/Q ratio would be possible, again creating an infinite number of states that cannot decay. While the relation between the decrease of the mass and the repulsion is trivial in the case of Reissner-Nordstr¨om black holes, the existence of other fields (e.g., the dilaton) makes the two arguments independent. In this paper we present calculations concerning corrections to the mass-charge relation of extremal black holes. Section 2 is dedicated to the case of four-derivative terms affecting Reissner-Nordstr¨om black holes (and Appendix B extends the result to the case of D dimensions). Section 3 discusses a heterotic black hole where the additional coupling to the dilaton must be included. In Section 4, we offer conclusions and a list of black objects that could be investigated. 2. Corrections to the Reissner-Nordstr¨om black hole The Reissner-Nordstr¨om black hole is a spherically symmetric static solution with a radial electric (or magnetic) field, governed by the action: The solution describes a black hole for M ≥ √ 2 κ |Q| (otherwise the solution describes a naked singularity). Black holes with the minimal possible mass M for a given charge Q are called extremal. In units with κ 2 = 2, they satisfy M = |Q| and the horizon radius r = M/4π = |Q|/4π. Corrections due to quantum gravity can be represented by higher-order terms in the effective action. For the purpose of determining the mass of an extremal black hole, we are interested in the solution near the horizon: r ∼ Q. The unperturbed solution (2.3) implies that any derivative contributes a factor of order 1/Q, so the Riemann tensor is R ∼ 1/Q2 , and for the electromagnetic field tensor we have F ∼ Q/r2 ∼ 1/Q and ∇F ∼ 1/Q2 . Since Q ≃ M ≫ 1, terms of higher order in R, F, and derivatives are suppressed by powers of 1/Q, and we may consider just the leading-order corrections. Both terms in (2.1) are ∼ 1/Q2 . The leading order (∼ 1/Q4 ) corrections are: We did not include a (∇µF µν)(∇ρFρν ) term because (∇µF µν ) and (∇ρFρν) vanish in the unperturbed solution, so variations of this term are proportional to additional powers of the correction coefficients ci . A similar argument applies to ec7F µνFνρF ρσFσµ, whose contribution to the equations of motion (to first order in ci) turns out to be equal to half the contribution of (F µνFµν ) 2 , related to the fact that only F 01 and F 10 are non-zero in the unperturbed solution. Therefore, in our problem ec7 can be absorbed in c7. The solution of the equations of motion for the metric is straightforward [12]. First, one can note that the spherical symmetry made it possible to express λ(r) and ν(r) explicitly in terms of Rµν as ) We take the higher-order terms in the action (2.4) to be a perturbation, treat them as a part of Smatter, and use the unperturbed solution (2.3) to calculate their corresponding Tµν . We also vary the action with respect to the gauge field to obtain corrections to Maxwell’s equations, which modify the contribution of the − 1 4 FµνF µν term to Tµν. The calculation of these two contributions to the effective Tµν is presented in Appendix A. The corrected metric in terms of m = M/4π and q = Q/4π We performed the same calculation in D spacetime dimensions, and the results are presented in Appendix B. We can use our results to check whether higher-order terms in the string theory effective action increase or decrease the mass-charge ratio in certain special cases. A U(1) gauge field can arise as a subgroup of the E8×E8 or SO(32) gauge group in the lowenergy effective theory of the heterotic string. We would like to consider a black hole charged under this U(1), while we set the remaining gauge fields and the antisymmetric field strength Hµνρ to zero. Consider heterotic string theory compactified on a (10−D)- dimensional torus. If we are able to stabilize the dilaton, then one possible background is a D-dimensional Reissner-Nordstr¨om black hole. (A black hole that involves the dilaton as well is discussed in the next section.) The ten-dimensional Lagrangian is  The dilaton has been set to a constant φ0 and h ≡ e −κ10φ0/ √ 2 . Such an assumption may be physically interpreted as a consequence of a dynamically generated potential for the dilaton in a particular compactification: the dilaton acquires mass much greater than the inverse radius of the black hole, its effects may be neglected, while the terms we consider are preserved. In D = 4, the Gauss-Bonnet combinati  is a topological invariant and does not influence the equations of motion. It does have an effect in other dimensions, where it interestingly cancels the (3D−7) factor in (B.15). While the effect of the Gauss-Bonnet terms is to increase the mass, the combination of the F 4 terms decreases the mass. (Note also that when the F 4 terms are express 3. Corrections to the GHS black hole In general, the low-energy effective action of the heterotic string includes also the dilaton field φ, which is sourced by the gauge field: so the net force between two extremal black holes with equal charges vanishes. The argument of Arkani-Hamed et al. would then predict that higher-order corrections to the mass and the dilatonic charge would make the mass smaller and the net force repulsive as the charge Q becomes smaller. Corrections to the metric and dilaton field of a magnetically-charged GHS black hole due to the next order terms (R2 , F 4 , F 2 (∇φ) 2 ) in the heterotic string effective action have been calculated by Natsuume [16]. After eliminating many of the terms by field redefinitions, he obtained the corrections to leading order in α ′ as  4. Discussion We have calculated the corrections to the masses of extremal black holes in several backgrounds. In all examples where we could verify the sign, the sign was negative. This fact was not guaranteed by the general rules of effective field theory; however, general arguments exist why such an inequality could follow from the consistency of couplings in quantum gravity [2]. Other examples of black objects where the inequality could be checked include non-supersymmetric black holes in type II string theory on Calabi-Yau manifolds and various black branes. It is desirable to find either a more general proof that the extremal black holes become lighter in general backgrounds of quantum gravity or a counterexample. We also conjecture that the first correction to the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy, arising from higher-derivative terms applied to Wald’s formula, is positive in all cases. We are not aware of counterexamples; explicit checks or a more general proof could shed some light on the UV-IR relations in quantum gravity.

18	1996	Dilatonic black holes in higher curvature string gravity	P. Kanti, 1 N. E. Mavromatos, 2 J. Rizos, 3 K. Tamvakis, 3,* and E. Winstanley 2	Dilatonic black holes in higher curvature string gravity We give analytical arguments and demonstrate numerically the existence of black hole solutions of the 4D effective superstring action in the presence of Gauss-Bonnet quadratic curvature terms. The solutions possess nontrivial dilaton hair. The hair, however, is of ‘‘secondary type,’’ in the sense that the dilaton charge is expressed in terms of the black hole mass. Our solutions are not covered by the assumptions of existing proofs of the ‘‘no-hair’’ theorem. We also find some alternative solutions with singular metric behavior, but finite energy. The absence of naked singularities in this system is pointed out.  I. INTRODUCTION It has become evident in recent years that the properties of black holes are modified when the theory of matter fields has sufficient structure. In the presence of the low-energy degrees of freedom characteristic of string theory @1#, i.e., dilatons, axions, and Abelian or Yang-Mills fields, it is possible to have nontrivial static configurations for these fields outside the horizon, i.e., to have black holes with hair @2,3#. It is not clear, however, whether these cases, in which the ‘‘nohair theorem’’ @4# does not apply @5#, represent stable solutions. Explicit black hole solutions have been found also in string-effective theories involving higher-order curvature corrections to the Einstein gravity. They exhibit secondary hair of the dilaton, axion, and modulus fields. The solutions were approximate, in the sense that only a perturbative analysis to O(a8) @6# and O(a8 2) @7# has been performed. This analysis motivates the search for exact ~to all orders in a8) solutions within the framework of curvature-squared corrections to Einstein’s theory. Although the effect of the higher-order curvature terms is not small for energy scales of order a8, from a local field theory point of view it makes sense to look for this kind of solutions, with the hope of drawing some useful conclusions that might be of relevance to the low-energy limit of string theories. In the present article we shall demonstrate the existence of black hole solutions of the Einstein-dilaton system in the presence of the higher-derivative, curvature squared terms. These solutions will be endowed with a nontrivial dilaton field outside the horizon, thus possessing dilaton hair. The treatment of the quadratic terms will be nonperturbative and the solutions are present for any value of a8/g2. What we shall argue in this paper is that the presence of these terms provides the necessary ‘‘repulsion’’ in the effective theory that balances the gravitational attraction, thereby leading to black holes dressed with nontrivial classical dilaton hair. An analogous phenomenon occurs already in the case of Einstein-Yang-Mills systems @3#. There the presence of the non-Abelian gauge field repulsion balances the gravitational attraction leading to black hole solutions with nontrivial gauge and scalar ~in Higgs systems! hair. It is useful to discuss briefly the situation in effective theories obtained from the string. We shall concentrate on the bosonic part of the gravitational multiplet which consists of the dilaton, graviton, and antisymmetric tensor fields. In this work we shall ignore the antisymmetric tensor for simplicity.1 As is well known in low-energy effective field theory, there are ambiguities in the coefficients of such terms, due to the possibility of local field redefinitions which leave the S-matrix amplitudes of the effective field theory invariant, according to the equivalence theorem. To O(a8) the freedom of such redefinitions is restricted to two generic structures, which cannot be removed by further redefinitions @8#. One is a curvature-squared combination, and the other is a four-derivative dilaton term. Thus, a generic form of the string-inspired O(a8) corrections to Einstein’s gravitation have the form ratio of the c1 coefficients is 2:0:1, respectively @8#. The case of superstring II effective theory, then, is characterized by the absence of curvature-squared terms. In such theories the fourth-order dilaton terms can still be, and in fact they are, present. In such a case, it is straightforward to see from the modern proof of the no-scalar-hair theorem of Ref. @4# that such theories cannot sustain to order O(a8), any nontrivial dilaton hair. On the other hand, the presence of curvaturesquared terms can drastically change the situation, as we shall discuss in this article. There is a simple reason to expect that in this case the no-scalar-hair theorem can be bypassed. In the presence of curvature-squared terms, the modified Einstein’s equation leads to an effective stress tensor that involves the gravitational field. This implies that the assumption of positive definiteness of the time component of this tensor, which in the Einstein case is the local energy density of the field, may, and as we shall show it does indeed, break down. The second, but equally important, reason is that as a result of the higher-curvature terms, there is an induced modification of the relation Tt t 5Tu u between the time and angular components of the stress tensor, which was valid in the case of spherically symmetric Einstein theories of Ref. @4#. The structure of the article is the following: In Sec. II we give analytic arguments for the existence of scalar ~dilaton! hair of the black hole solution, which bypasses the conditions for the no-hair theorem. In Sec. III we present an analysis of the black hole solutions. In Sec. IV we discuss alternative solutions, some of which are interesting due to the finite energy-momentum tensor they possess. Finally, conclusions and outlook are presented in Sec. V. II. EXISTENCE OF HAIR IN GRAVITY WITH A GAUSSBONNET TERM: ANALYTIC ARGUMENTS Following the above discussion we shall ignore, for simplicity, the fourth-derivative dilaton terms in Eq. ~1!, setting from now on c250. However, we must always bear in mind that such terms are nonzero in realistic effective string cases, once the GB combination is fixed for the gravitational O(a8) parts. Then, the Lagrangian for dilaton gravity with a Gauss-Bonnet term reads where RGB 2 is the Gauss-Bonnet ~GB! term ~2!. As we mentioned in the Introduction, although we view Eq. ~3! as a heterotic-string effective action, for simplicity, in this paper we shall ignore the modulus and axion fields, assuming reality of the dilaton (S5ef in the notation of Ref. @6#!. We commence our analysis by noting that the dilaton field and Einstein’s equations derived from Eq. ~3! are It should be stressed that the time component of 2Tmn , which in Einstein’s gravity would correspond to the local energy density E, may not be positive. Indeed, as we shall see later on, for spherically symmetric space-times, there are regions where this quantity is negative. The reason is that, as a result of the higher-derivative GB terms, there are contributions of the gravitational field itself to Tmn . From a string theory point of view, this is reflected in the fact that the dilaton is part of the string gravitational multiplet. Thus, this is the first important indication on the possibility of evading the no-scalar-hair theorem of Ref. @4# in this case. However, this by itself is not sufficient for a rigorous proof of an evasion of the no-hair conjecture. We shall come to this point later on. At the moment, let us consider a spherically symmetric space-time having the metric Before we proceed to study the above system it is useful to note that if we turn off the Gauss-Bonnet term, Eq. ~10! can be integrated to give f8;(1/r2)e(L2G)/2. A black hole solution should have at the horizon rh the behavior e2G, eL→`. Therefore, the radial derivative of the dilaton would diverge on the horizon resulting into a divergent energymomentum tensor In the relations ~18! there lies the second reason for a possibility of an evasion of the no-hair conjecture. Due to the presence of the higher-curvature contributions, the relation Tt t 5Tu u assumed in Ref. @4# is no longer valid. The alert reader must have noticed, then, the similarity of the role played by the Gauss-Bonnet O(a8) terms in the Lagrangian ~3! with the case of the non-Abelian gauge black holes studied in Ref. @5#. There the presence of the non-Abelian gauge field repulsive forces also lead to nontrivial contributions to Tu u ÞTt t leading to a sort of ‘‘balancing’’ between this repulsion and the gravitational attraction. We stress, once again, however, that in our case both the nonpositivity of the ‘‘energy-density’’ Tt t and the modified relation Tt t ÞTu u play equally important roles in leading to a possibility of having nontrivial classical scalar ~dilaton! hair in GB black holes’ systems. Below, we shall demonstrate rigorously this, by showing that there is no contradiction between the results following from the conservation equation of the ‘‘energymomentum tensor’’ Tmn and the field equations, in the presence of nontrivial dilaton hair. Far away from the origin, the unknown functions f(r), eL(r) , and eG(r) can be expanded in a power series in 1/r. These expansions, substituted back into the equations, are finally expressed in terms of three parameters only, chosen to be f` , the asymptotic value of the dilaton, the ArnowittDeser-Misner ~ADM! mass M, and the dilaton charge D defined as @10# As we will see below the relation ~35! guarantees the finiteness of fh 9 , and hence of the ‘‘local density’’ Tt t @Eq. ~18!#. Both these solutions for fh 8 are negative, and hence, since Tr r (rh) has the opposite sign to fh 8, Tr r will be positive sufficiently close to the horizon. Since Tr r >0 also at infinity, we observe that there is no contradiction with Einstein’s equations, thereby allowing for the existence of black holes with scalar hair. We observe that near the horizon the quantity E (2Tt t ), which in Einstein’s gravitation would be the local energy density of the field f, is negative. As we mentioned earlier, this constitutes one of the reasons one should expect an evasion of the no-scalar-hair conjecture in this black hole space-time. Crucial also for this result was the presence of additional terms in Eq. ~18!, leading to Tt t ÞTu u . Both of these features, whose absence in the case of Einstein-scalar gravity was crucial for the modern proof of the no-hair theorem, owe their existence in the presence of the higher-order O(a8) corrections in Eq. ~3!. The physical importance of the restriction ~35! lies in the fact that according to this relation, black hole solutions of a given horizon radius can only exist if the coupling constant of the Gauss-Bonnet term in Eq. ~3! is smaller than a critical value, set by the magnitude of the horizon scale. In fact from Eq. ~35!, reality of fh 8 is guaranteed if and only if In this picture, b[ 1 4efh can then be viewed as the ~appropriately normalized with respect to the Einstein term! coupling constant of the GB term in the effective Lagrangian ~3!. For a black hole of unit horizon radius rh51, the critical value of b, above which black hole solutions cannot exist, is then bc5g2/4A6a8. One is tempted to compare the situation with the case of SU~2! sphaleron solutions in the presence of Gauss-Bonnet terms @9#. Numerical analysis of sphaleron solutions in such systems reveals the existence of a critical value for the GB coefficient above which solutions do not exist. In the sphaleron case this number depends on the number of nodes of the Yang-Mills gauge field. In our case, if one fixes the position of the horizon, then it seems that in order to construct black hole solutions with this horizon size the GB coefficient has to satisfy Eq. ~36!. Thus, a way of interpreting Eq. ~35! is to view it as providing a necessary condition for the absence of naked singularities in spacetime. To understand better this latter point, we should consider the scalar curvature in the limit r→rh . It is This expression shows that the curvature is singular at rh→0, i.e., when the horizon shrinks. The point rh50 can be reached only when fh52`. Thus, the inequality ~36!, in a sense, forbids rh to become zero and reveal the singularity. Above, we have argued on the possibility of having black holes in the system ~3! that admit nontrivial dilaton hair outside their horizon. The key is the bypassing of the no-hair theorem @4#, as a result of the curvature-squared terms. In what follows we shall write down explicit solutions of the equations of motion originating from Eq. ~3! and provide evidence for the existence of black hole solutions to all orders in a8. Unfortunately, a complete analytic treatment of these equations is not feasible, and one has to use numerical methods. This complicates certain things, in particular, it does not allow for a clear view of what happens inside the horizon, thereby not giving any information on the curvature singularity structure. III. NUMERICAL ANALYSIS We now proceed to the numerical integration. Starting from the solution ~A8!–~A10!, at r5rh1e, e.1028, we integrate the system ~A3!, ~A4! towards r→` using the fourth-order Runge-Kutta method with an automatic step procedure and accuracy 1028. The integration stops when the flat space-time asymptotic limit ~20!–~22! is reached. Note that only the choice s511 in Eq. ~A8! leads to solutions which have the desired behavior ~22! for the dilaton field at infinity. Since L(r) is not an independent variable, and fh 8 is related to fh and rh through Eq. ~A8!, it seems that the only independent parameters of the problem are fh , rh , and g1. Note that the equations of motion do not yield any constraint for g1. This is due to the fact that the equations of motion ~10!–~13! do not involve G(r) but only G8(r). Thus, only G8(r) can be determined by them and in order to obtain G(r) a final integration has to be performed. This integration involves an integration constant g1 which will be fixed by demanding the asymptotically flat limit ~21!. Thus, the only independent parameters are just fh and rh . Note, however, that the equations of motion remain invariant under a shift f→f1f0 as long as it is accompanied by a radial rescaling r→ref0/2. Due to the above invariance it is sufficient to vary only one of rh and fh . For calculational convenience we set rh51. It turns out that for every value of the shooting parameter fh , satisfying the inequality ~36!, there is a black hole solution regular at infinity. This is another new feature which follows from the presence of the Gauss-Bonnet term. It is interesting to note that beyond a value of the input parameter fh , the black hole reaches quickly its Schwarzschild value 2M5rh . Note that the dilaton charge does not vanish. The approach to the Schwarzschild limit is a reflection of the fact that as we move to fh values smaller than the critical value ln(1/A6) 520.89588 . . . , the variation of the dilaton field f(r) with r becomes eventually weaker and the dilaton ultimately behaves as a constant. For an almost constant dilaton the Gauss-Bonnet term is irrelevant and the mass takes up its Schwarzschild value. At the end of our numerical calculation and in order to fix a unique scale, we impose on the dilaton field the asymptotic condition f`50. This requires a shift f→f2f` as well as a rescaling r→re2f`/2. Since the radial coordinate has been rescaled, the other two asymptotic IV. ADDITIONAL SOLUTIONS A second class of solutions can be obtained if we allow f8(r) to be infinite at some finite value rs of the coordinate r. This choice, as we shall argue below, is not incompatible with the finiteness of the energy-momentum tensor. This is due to the fact that the Gauss-Bonnet term does not have a definite signature. These solutions have the same asymptotic characterization in terms of f` , M, and D as the black hole. Near r.rs , one obtains As we can see, these solutions cannot be classified as black hole solutions since the metric component gtt does not exhibit any singular behavior: eG→const when r→rs . Only grr takes on an infinite value when rs is approached. In order to determine whether the space-time geometry is really singular at rs , the scalar curvature R as well as the ‘‘curvature invariant’’ I5Rmnrs Rmnrs were calculated. It turns out that none of the above quantities exhibits any singular behavior at rs which implies that the pathology of the metric is due to a pathology of the coordinate system and not due to the space-time geometry itself. Moreover, this guarantees the finiteness of the action ~it can be easily checked that the Gauss-Bonnet combination is also finite which is consistent with the field redefinition ambiguity arguments given in the introduction!. It is a simple exercise to verify that the components of the energy-momentum tensor are also finite. They are shown in Fig. 7. Unfortunately, at present, we are not in a position to discuss the nature of the solutions for r<rs , and hence the only safe conclusion to be made from the above analysis concerns the absence of a naked singularity. It is interesting to mention the existence of another class of solutions, which are regular in the metric, do not possess any horizon, but the dilaton becomes infinite at r.0. Near the origin these solutions are This is also a two-parameter family of solutions. The far asymptotic behavior is still given by Eqs. ~20!–~22!, and it is again characterized by the parameters f` , M, and D. These solutions appear to have no curvature singularities @R(r.0).0#, but the components of the energy-momentum tensor are infinite at r.0. Note that our black hole solution appears to be a boundary surface in the phase space between solutions ~42! and ~46!. This means that, if f0, f0 8 , G0, and G0 8 are the values of the fields for the black hole solution at r5r0@1, then integration of the system ~A3! and ~A4!, starting from r0 with f8(r0).f0 8 , leads to the solution ~42!, while the case f8(r0),f0 8 leads to the solution ~46!. V. CONCLUSIONS AND OUTLOOK In this paper we have dealt with solutions of the coupled dilaton-graviton system in four dimensions, in the presence of higher-curvature terms in the Gauss-Bonnet combination. We have demonstrated the existence of black hole solutions for this system, characterized by nontrivial scalar ~dilaton! hair. This hair is of ‘‘secondary’’-type, in the sense that it is not accompanied by the presence of any new quantity that characterizes the black hole. Indeed, it was shown above that the dilaton charge is not an independent quantity, but it can be expressed in terms of the mass of the black hole. It should be stressed, however, that irrespective of the precise type of hair, the set of solutions examined in this work bypasses the conditions of the no-hair theorem @4#. Thus, our solutions may be viewed as demonstrating that there is plenty of room in the gravitational structure of superstring theory to allow for physically sensible situations that are not covered by the theorem as stated. Although our results were derived in the framework of the O(a8) effective superstring action, they are nonperturbative in nature and they will persist at least in situations of moderate curvatures. In addition to the black hole solutions, we were able to find two other families of solutions, one of which had the interesting feature of having finite energy density. At present, the physical significance of the solutions is not fully clear to us. We hope to be able to study these structures in the near future. There are many features of the solutions which we did not address in this work, one of which is their stability under either linear time-dependent perturbations of the gravitondilaton multiplet, or under generic perturbations ~beyond linearity!. Such an analysis has been performed for the Einstein-Yang-Mills-Higgs system @5#, and one could think of extending it to incorporate higher-curvature gravity theories. A stability analysis, when completed, will prove essential in understanding better the physical significance of the black hole solutions found in this work. This is of particular interest due to the connection of the solutions with superstring theory. We hope to return to these issues in a future publication.	We give analytical arguments and demonstrate numerically the existence of black hole solutions of the 4D effective superstring action in the presence of Gauss-Bonnet quadratic curvature terms. The solutions possess nontrivial dilaton hair. The hair, however, is of ‘‘secondary type,’’ in the sense that the dilaton charge is expressed in terms of the black hole mass. Our solutions are not covered by the assumptions of existing proofs of the ‘‘no-hair’’ theorem. We also find some alternative solutions with singular metric behavior, but finite energy. The absence of naked singularities in this system is pointed out. 
19	2019	Charged scalar quasi-normal modes for higher-dimensional Born-Infeld dilatonic black holes with Lifshitz scaling	S. Sedigheh Hashemi,1 Mahdi Kord Zangeneh,2, 3, ∗ and Mir Faizal4, 5	Charged scalar quasi-normal modes for higher-dimensional Born-Infeld dilatonic black holes with Lifshitz scaling We study quasi-normal modes for a higher dimensional black hole with Lifshitz scaling, as these quasi-normal modes can be used to test Lifshitz models with large extra dimensions. Furthermore, as the effective Planck scale is brought down in many models with large extra dimensions, we study these quasi-normal modes for a UV completion action. Thus, we analyze quasi-normal modes for higher dimensional dilaton-Lifshitz black hole solutions coupled to a non-linear Born-Infeld action. We will analyze the charged perturbations for such a black hole solution. We will first analyze the general conditions for stability analytically, for a positive potential. Then, we analyze this system for a charged perturbation as well as negative potential, using the asymptotic iteration method for quasi-normal modes. Thus, we analyze the behavior of these modes numerically.I. INTRODUCTION Mathematically ideal black holes are usually studied as isolated systems. However, this mathematical idealization cannot be actualized in any real world system. This is because black holes will always interact with matter surrounding it. Even if all the matter around a black hole could be removed, it would still interact with the vacuum around it, and thus cannot be considered an isolated system. So, in any realistic description of a black hole we would have to consider such perturbative effects on the basic parameters describing such a black hole. Such perturbations of a black hole lead to the emission of gravitational waves [1]. Initially there is an short outburst, which is followed by long period of damping oscillations in the form of quasi-normal modes (QNMs) [2–4], and finally these QNMs are suppressed at late times by powerlaw or exponential tails. A complex frequency called the quasi-normal frequency (QNF) is associated with these QNMs [5–7]. The real part of this complex frequency represents the frequency of oscillation, and its imaginary part represents the rate of damping of that oscillation. In this paper, we will be analyzing the QNMs as they are the most interesting phase of radiation, which can have interesting physical consequences. This is because the study of gravitational wave has become important due to the detection of these wave in GW150914 [8], and the analysis of QNMs from the data obtained from gravitational antennas such as LIGO, VIRGO and LISA, can have important consequences [9–12]. The existence of extra dimensions in string theory has motivated the study of black hole in large extra-dimensions, such that the the extra dimensions are large enough to suppress the ∗Electronic address: mkzangeneh@scu.ac.ir †Electronic address: mirfaizalmir@googlemail.com Planck scale to the T eV scale [13–16]. These models have been generalized to Randall-Sundrum brane world models with warped extra dimensions, such that the effective Planck scale again reduce to a T eV scale [17, 18]. It has been argued that such models motivated by string theory can be detected by analyzing the QNMs obtained from gravitational antennas [19–22]. However, as the effective Planck scale is brought down in these models, it is important to consider a UV completion of the effective theory in four dimensions for analyzing such black holes. An important UV completion of the effective field theory, obtained as a low energy limit of string theory is the Dbranes action, which can be described by a Born-Infeld (BI) action coupled to dilaton field [24–27]. So, in this paper, we will analyze the QNMs from a black hole in such a theory with a BI action coupled to a dilaton field. It may be noted that another interesting UV completion of general relativity, motivated by a formalism developed in condensed matter physics, is the Horava-Lifshitz gravity [28, 29]. The space and time scale with different Lifshitz scaling in the Horava-Lifshitz gravity, such that it reduces to general relativity in the IR limit, but differs from general relativity in the UV limit. In fact, motivated by Horava-Lifshitz gravity, the consequences of such different Lifshitz scaling have been studied for various geometrical structures that occur in the string theory. Such a Lifshitz scale has been studied for both type IIA string theory [30] and type IIB string theory [31]. The behavior of dilaton black branes [32, 33] and dilaton black holes [34, 35] with Lifshitz scaling has also been discussed. Furthermore, such black solutions in a BI non-linear action with Lifshitz scaling have also been studied [36]. The brane world models with warped extra dimensions and Lifshitz scaling have also been constructed [37, 38]. It may be noted that even though the charged scalar perturbations are important [39–44], mostly QNMs in Lifshitz theories have been studied for neutral scalar 2 perturbations [45–52]. However, QNMs for a charged dilaton-Lifshitz solutions in the four dimensions have also been studied [53]. As the QNMs can be used to test models with large extra dimensions with Lifshitz scaling, it is important to study the QNMs for higher dimensional analogs of such a black hole. Furthermore, as the effective Planck scale is brought down in many models with large extra dimensions, it is important to discuss such results using a UV completion of such a theory. Thus, we will analyze the QNMs from a higher dimensional dilaton-Lifshitz black hole solutions coupled to a nonlinear Born-Infeld action. We organize this paper as follows: In section II, we will review the dilaton-Lifshitz black hole solutions in the presence of BI nonlinear electrodynamics. In section III, the wave equations of charged scalar perturbations around our black holes will be presented. In latter section, we will analyze the QNMs analytically. Then, we will use the asymptotic iteration method to analyze QNMs numerically in section IV. Finally, in the last section, we will summarize our results and discuss about them. II. LIFSHITZ SOLUTIONS In this section, we will analyze a higher dimensional black hole in a UV complete theory. Thus, we will consider a dilaton-Lifshitz black hole coupled to non-linear BI action. The metric for such a (n + 1)-dimensional Lifshitz black holes can be expressed as [32, 46] In this paper, we will analyze the coupling of a Lifshitz spacetime to a non-linear BI action. So, first we observe that in the absence of dilaton field, the function L(F) for BI Lagrangian is given by [54]  We can observe from this solution, that in the limit r → ∞, f(r) satisfies f(r) → 1 (note that F (a, b, c, 0) = 1). It may be noted that for z = n + 1, a Schwartzshildlike black hole does not exist in this system, because as r → 0, f(r) will go to positive infinity f(r) → +∞. Nevertheless, for z 6= n + 1, the Schwartzshild-like black hole do exists in this system (apart from the extreme and non-extreme black holes and naked singularities). From here on, we fix l and b to unity. III. QUASI-NORMAL MODES Now in this section, we will analyze the QNMs for the solution discussed in the previous section. So, first we consider a minimally coupled charged massive scalar field in such a spherically symmetric black hole background. It is assumed that this field satisfies the Klein-Gordon equation  where Dν = ∇ν − iqsAν is the gauge covariant derivative and ms is the mass of the scalar field Ψ. Now we decompose Ψ into the following standard form  where Y (angles) is the spherical harmonic function related to the angular coordinates, and ω is the frequency. As Y is the spherical harmonic function, it satisfies the following equatio  where d = n + 1. So, using a tortoise coordinate r∗ as dr∗/dr =  r z+1f(r) −1 , and introducing a new radial function R(r) as R(r) = K(r)/r, the Eq. (20) can be transformed into an equation resembling the Schr¨odinger equation  Here we first observe that the first and the second terms are positive (with m2 s > 0). Now as d ≥ 4, so the term (1 − d/2) is negative. Thus, by having positive f(r) and f ′ (r) out of the horizon r > rh, we can obtain V (r) > 0 out of horizon provided that m2 s > 0. Note that m2 s can be negative as long as it is above BreitenlohnerFreedman(-like) bound. One may read this bound from Eq. (35) in next section  Now we observe from this equation that for the potential V to be positive outside the horizon, imaginary part of ω is negative. So, for a neutral scalar field, the black hole is stable under scalar field perturbation, if the potential is positive outside the horizon (i.e. as long as m2 s > 0). In next section, we proceed more to study charged scalar fields numerically. We investigate the behavior of potential for m2 s < 0, as wel  IV. NUMERICAL ANALYSIS In the previous section, we analyzed the stability of our black hole system, when the potential was positive outside the horizon and scalar perturbation was neutral. However, we cannot obtain such general results for charged scalar fields as well as negative potential. To understand the behavior of this system generally, we need to analyze it numerically. So, in this section, we will analyze the behavior of QNMs numerically using the asymptotic iteration method (AIM) [59]. Now we first change the variable u = 1 − rh/r, and write Eq. (20)  . A. Numerical results In this section, we present the numerical results for the QNM of the charged scalar perturbation around Lifshitz black hole and the effective potential V (r ∗ ) as a function of tortoise coordinate r ∗ . We will consider two cases, one for the case with d 6= z (Figures 1 and 3), and the other one with d = z (Figures 2 and 4). The frequency of quasi-normal modes have both real and imaginary parts, ω = ωR + iωI . So, the factor e −iωt in scalar field (Eq. (18)) becomes e −iωRt e ωI t . Therefore, ωR and ωI determine the energy of scalar perturbations and the stability of the system under dynamical perturbationas, respectively. If ωI > 0, the scalar field grows with time and therefore the black hole is not stable under this perturbation. If ωI < 0, the black hole system is stable under dynamical perturbation since the scalar field vanishes as time passes. For larger values of |ωI |, the perturbation remains longer outside the black hole untill it disappears. From holographic point of view, it means that it takes more time for the dual system to go back to equilibrium. As one can see from Figures 1 and 2, for both d = z and d 6= z cases, for fixed values of β, |ωI | decreases as q increases (or equivalently temperature T decreases). According to what explained above, it means that by increasing q, the complete decay of scalar perturbat outside the black hole takes more time. Holographically, it shows that dual system needs more time to return to equilibrium. As Figures 1(a) and 1(b) show, for d 6= z case, by increasing q, ωR increases up to a maximum value first and then decreases. The value of maximum for a fixed d and z, depends on nonlinear parameter β. For larger values of β, the maximum value of ωR is lower. It means that by increasing the effects of nonlinearity, the maximum energy of perturbation decreases. For specific values of d and z, the influence of β on real and imaginary parts of quasi-normal frequencies disappears as q tends to smaller values (higher T ). Moreover, for smaller values of β but fixed d and z, the real part of quasi-normal frequencies is larger in general as q is further away from zero. The latter result shows that the perturbation has more energy in linear electrodynamics case. Furthermore, for larger values of z, the maximum energy of perturbations is lower (Figures 1(a) and 1(b)). In d = z case, we have the same behaviors as d 6= z case (Figures 2(a) and 2(b)). However, as Figures 1(a) and 1(c) show, in the case of d 6= z, for fixed z, by increasing d, the behavior of ωR with respect to q may change. For d = 5 and z = 2, ωR shows a decreasing trend as q increases. In the case with z 6= d and m2 s < 0, the effective potential as a function of r ∗ are plotted in Figure 3. In Figure 3(a), with d = 4, and z = 2, each potential has a well, whose height depends on the value of m2 s and β. With the same β, the one with lower m2 s , has a higher hight of the well. The highest hight of the well in this case is obtained when β = 0.1 and m2 s = −26. Moreover, the same behaviors is obtained by going to higher dimension, such as d = 5, as depicted in Figure 3(b). This shows that the particle described by the scalar field is traped in the potential of the black hole in these cases. Another case is obtained by setting d = z, where the dimension of spacetime equals the dynamical critical exponent z (Figure 4). For d = z cases, the same behavior is obtained as in Figure 3, in which the potential has a well. In order to see the effects of the existence of the extra dimension, in Figure 4(b), we consider the case d = z = 5. V. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSION In this paper, we analyze the behavior of quasi-normal modes (QNMs) for a higher dimensional black hole with Lifshitz scaling. This is important as the QNMs can be used to test models with large extra dimensions with Lifshitz scaling. In fact, as the effective Planck scale is lowered in such models with large extra dimensions, we study these QNMs for a UV completion action. This UV completion action is motivated by Born-Infeld action for a D-brane action, which is a UV completion of the ordinary action for linear actions of such systems. So, in this paper, the QNMs for higher dimensional dilaton-Lifshitz black hole solutions coupled to a non-linear Born-Infeld action have been studied. As it is important to study the charged perturbations for such a black hole solution, such charged perturbations were studied. In fact, we first analyzed general conditions for stability analytically, for a positive potential. However, as it was not possible to perform such an analysis for a charged perturbation as well as a negative potential, we analyze this system for these cases numerically. This was done using the asymptotic iteration method for quasi-normal modes. This is done by analyzing this system for two cases, i.e., when d 6= z, and when d = z. For both cases, it is observed that the absolute value of imaginary parts of quasi-normal frequencies decreases as charge of black hole increase to extremal value. It means that it takes more time for QNMs to completely decay outside the black hole. If one wants to interprete this in AdS/CFT language, it shows that it needs more time for the system to go back to equilibrium under the perturbation. Increasing the charge of black hole, the real part of quasi-normal frequencies first increase up to a maximum and then decreases. The value of this maximum is dependent on the nonlinearity parameter β and is higher for lower values of this. In the case of d 6= z, we have a different behavior for real part of quasi-normal frequencies as the dimension of space-time increases. For d = 5 6= z, we observed that increase in value of black hole charge (equivalently decrease in black hole temperature) cause the real part of quasi-normal frequencies to decrease. To study the behavior of potential, we depicted the potential in tortoise coordinate with m2 s < 0, for both d 6= z and d = z cases. We observed that potential is partly negative and has a well. For d = 4, each potential has a well whose hight depends on the β and m2 s . The same behavior is observed for d = 5. It is observed that for the second case, the high of well depends on β, and for a fixed β, the high depends on the value of m2 s . Thus, the behavior of this system depends both on β and m2 s for a fixed dimension. The QNMs have also become important in string theory, due to the development of AdS/CFT correspondence [60, 61]. It has been observed that the poles of the retarded Green function in a conformal field theory on the boundary of an AdS space is related to the QNMs of a asymptotically AdS black hole. Thus, QNMs of a higher dimensional AdS black hole can be used to describe the behavior of strongly coupled quark-gluon plasmas [62, 63]. As the AdS/CFT correspondence has been used to analyze the CFT dual to a Lifshitz AdS spacetime [64, 65], it would be interesting to repeat the analysis done in this paper, for an asymptotically AdS black hole. Then such QNMs can be used to analyze various properties of CFT dual to such a black hole in the Lifshitz AdS spacetime. It would also be interesting to analyze the effect that UV completion of the theory has on the dual CFT. It may be noted that in this paper, we have used an abelian Born-Infeld action, in which a U(1) gauge field was coupled in a non-linear action. The abelian Born-Infeld action has been generalized to a nonabelian Born-Infeld action [66, 67]. Furthermore, black hole solution in such a theory with non-abelian BornInfeld have also been constructed [68, 69]. It would be interesting to calculate the QNMs for such black holes with a non-abelian Born-Infeld action. It would also be interesting to analyze the QNMs for such black holes in an asymptotically AdS spacetime, and then use the AdS/CFT correspondence to analyze the CFT dual to such a system.	higher-dimensional Born-Infeld dilatonic black holes with Lifshitz scaling We study quasi-normal modes for a higher dimensional black hole with Lifshitz scaling, as these quasi-normal modes can be used to test Lifshitz models with large extra dimensions. Furthermore, as the effective Planck scale is brought down in many models with large extra dimensions, we study these quasi-normal modes for a UV completion action. Thus, we analyze quasi-normal modes for higher dimensional dilaton-Lifshitz black hole solutions coupled to a non-linear Born-Infeld action. We will analyze the charged perturbations for such a black hole solution. We will first analyze the general conditions for stability analytically, for a positive potential. Then, we analyze this system for a charged perturbation as well as negative potential, using the asymptotic iteration method for quasi-normal modes. Thus, we analyze the behavior of these modes numerically.
20	2018	Observational signatures from horizonless black shells imitating rotating black holes	Ulf H. Danielsson and Suvendu Giri	Observational signatures from horizonless black shells imitating rotating black holes  Abstract: In arXiv:1705.10172 it was proposed that string theory replaces Schwarzschild black holes with horizonless thin shells with an AdS interior. In this paper we extend the analysis to slowly rotating black holes, solving the Israel-Lanczos-Sen junction conditions for a rotating shell composed of stringy matter to determine the metric. Outside of the shell we find a vacuum solution that differs from Kerr with a 32% larger quadrupole moment. We discuss the observational consequences and explore the possibility to distinguish between a black shell and a black hole. Promising methods include imaging of the black hole at the center of the Milky Way using the Event Horizon Telescope, precision measurements of stars in close orbits around the central black hole, and future observations of colliding super massive black holes using the space based gravitational wave observatory LISA. 1 Introduction One of the most important problems in black hole physics is the reconciliation of the thermal nature of Hawking radiation with unitary evolution in quantum mechanics. The existence of this “information paradox” [1] relies on black holes having a horizon. An early attempt to resolve the paradox was the idea of black hole complementarity [2, 3], which suggests that an infalling and an outgoing observer see complimentary pictures of the information falling into the black hole. In this way there is no loss of information. However, it was suggested that the idea of black hole complementarity might be incomplete [4] and the idea of firewalls was proposed [5]. In parallel, another way to resolve the paradox was proposed [6–9] suggesting that a black hole is a collection of microstates, each of which describes a smooth horizonless geometry. The conventional picture of a black hole being a central singularity surrounded by empty space, and shielded by a horizon, is thus replaced by an effective description of the statistical ensemble of smooth horizonless geometries (see [10] for a review). There has been extensive work in constructing smooth supergravity solutions corresponding to these fuzzball microstates [11–13] (see e.g. [14] for a review). Other compact horizonless objects that could mimic black holes, and thus resolve the information paradox, have also been proposed (see [15] for a summary of these objects). One such possibility that was recently suggested in [16] is that string theory naturally prevents the formation of a horizon at the end point of gravitational collapse, and in this way removes the paradox. Instead of obtaining a black hole, it was argued that a bubble of AdS-space is formed that is contained within a thin shell of branes supporting some stringy matter: a black shell. The tension of these branes, as well as the negative cosmological constant in their interior, is set by the scale of high energy physics making the total energy of the shell and the vacuum inside enormous for an astrophysical black hole. Still, they balance in such a way that the tension of the brane compensates for the negative cosmological constant, and the effective mass measured from outside is just the mass of a traditional black hole. Our proposal seems to be different from the fuzzball idea but it would be interesting to explore possible connections. The black shells we introduced in [16] are similar to the gravastars discussed in [17]. The crucial difference is that we, motivated by string theory, consider an AdS interior with a negative cosmological constant rather than a de Sitter interior with a positive cosmological constant. In our paper we solved the Israel-Lanczos-Sen junction conditions [18–20] in detail and found, quite remarkably, that given some basic assumptions about the equations of state of the string matter, the radius of the shell is uniquely determined and turns out to be the Buchdahl radius (= 9Rs/8 = 9M/4). Buchdahl [21] showed that this is the smallest possible radius of a star (modeled as a sphere of incompressible fluid) provided that the pressure is isotropic, and that the density does not increase outward. Schwarzschild [22] had derived the same limit when considering the interior metric of an incompressible fluid sphere and Buchdahl generalized the result to any matter distribution with the above properties. In [16] we also discussed the construction of black shells from string theory in some detail. Starting with an explicit supersymmetric construction of an extremal ReissnerNordstr¨om black hole in Type IIA string theory compactified on T 6/ (Z2 × Z2), we argued that these shells could be made of branes with world volume directions both along the shell as well as internal space, together with lower dimensional branes wrapping only the compact internal space. From the point of view of space time, these look like point particles (D0 branes) dissolved in higher dimensional branes, with a gas of open strings stretching between them. The radius of the shell at equilibrium can be obtained by solving the junction conditions. However, to understand the perturbative stability of the shell around such a critical point, one needs to consider quantum effects. In [16] we suggested that the shell is heated to the local Unruh temperature since it is accelerating relative to the local inertial frame. This is analogous to how one can argue for the Hawking temperature using an imaginary surface positioned just outside the horizon. One calculates the local Unruh temperature on that surface, which diverges in the limit where the surface approaches the horizon, and then calculates the asymptotic Hawking temperature using the gravitational redshift. Our argument differs in that the shell is now a physical object instead of being just an imaginary surface. Furthermore, it is positioned at a macroscopic distance away from where the horizon would have been. The resulting asymptotic temperature turns out to be a little less than the Hawking temperature. These shells indeed appear “black” as they should in order to be compatible with observations. As was shown in [16], they carry an enormously large number of degrees of freedom (just as in the case of a conventional black hole) but have an extremely low temperature. By the second law of thermodynamics, the high entropy ensures that infalling matter sticks to the shell, and becomes part of the degrees of freedom of the string gas sitting on top of the shell, while the low temperature ensures that nothing is radiated out for a long time. This ensures that the shells appear black. In [16] we also proposed a mechanism for the formation of the black shells, and how it guarantees that horizons can never appear. We made use of a background Minkowski space time that was metastable against the nucleation of vacuum bubbles of AdS. The life time of the vacuum was assumed to be extremely long, many times longer than the age of the universe. We argued that if a bubble nucleates on top of a collapsing shell of matter, there is a huge increase in the available phase space, and the low probability of its nucleation is compensated by a similar increase in its entropy. This comes about since the infalling matter has much less entropy compared to the one carried by the gas of strings on the brane. In this way the bubble “catches” the infalling matter, is trapped and prevented from expanding much further, and finally settles down to a radius dictated by the junction conditions and temperature induced stability. Most astrophysical black holes are believed to be rotating, often with close to maximal spin [23, 24]. In order to test the idea that black holes really are black shells, we therefore need to extend the construction in [16] to rotating black holes. This is technically much more challenging, and in the present work we focus on the limit of slow rotation. Here we do not provide an explicit construction of such slowly rotating black shells from string theory but rather use the components that arise from a string construction of black shells [16] (namely the energy-momentum tensor being made of three pieces — tension (p = −ρ), massless gas (p = ρ/2) and stiff matter (p = ρ)) to construct these shells. We hope to return to an explicit construction from string theory in a future work. There is substantial literature discussing the space time outside rotating compact objects [25–30]. In the absence of spin (and charge), assuming spherical symmetry, the exterior geometry of such objects is uniquely described by the Schwarzschild metric. In the presence of spin the geometry is unique, provided there is a horizon, and is given by the Kerr solution [31, 32]. In our case, the external geometry is cut off at the shell (which sits well outside the horizon at 9M/4 for the Schwarzschild case), the no-hair theorem does not apply, and there is no reason to expect the metric to be described by the Kerr solution. In fact, the geometry outside axially symmetric rotating objects is not unique, and contributions with non-vanishing Weyl curvature can be added using the Kerr solution as a starting point. Under the assumption of a metastable Minkowski vacuum together with stringy matter, we suggest that the bubble nucleation mechanism of [16] prevents the formation of a Kerr black hole. The geometry outside such rotating black shells differs from Kerr and the stringy matter on the shell uniquely fixes the deviation away from the Kerr geometry. Of particular interest is that our construction predicts that the quadrupole moment is about 32% greater than that of the Kerr geometry. We begin our discussion by presenting the space time geometry inside and outside the shell in section 2. In section 3, we solve the junction conditions at first order in the rotation parameter a and calculate the stress energy tensor on the shell. We show how this can be understood as a high tension brane with some stringy matter on top. In section 4, we do the computation at second order in a and obtain the main results of this work. We discuss astrophysical implications of this proposal and suggest ways to test it in section 5. In section 6 we end with a summary of our results and an outlook. 2 Spacetime geometry inside and outside the shell 2.1 Outside the shell The Kerr metric in Boyer-Lindquist coordinates can be written as 6) The ansatz in (2.3) is of the same form as the Novikov-Manko metric [26], and their solution indeed solves (2.4). It can be seen from (2.5) that our solution is different from theirs e.g. unlike ours, the Novikov-Manko solution does not have logarithms. The asymptotic behavior is the same at leading order but differs at next to leading order. Next, we consider another stationary axially symmetric geometry of the  To understand this metric, we can compute its Geroch-Hansen multipole moments [33, 34]. These are coordinate invariant quantities that can be defined for asymptotically flat spacetimes. They consist of mass moments Mi , and current moments Ji that uniquely characterize a space time. While mass moments describe how matter is distributed over the object, current moments describe the flow of matter. The original method proposed by Geroch and Hansen is quite laborious to implement, and we adopt a prescription by Fodor, Hohenselaers and Perj´es [35] using the Ernst potential outlined in [36].1 The result is:  Higher moments are of the form M2k = (−1)k M a2k and J2k+1 = (−1)k M a2k+1 (which come from the Kerr metric) plus terms containing p and q that appear with a n where n > 2. Since our exterior metric is a solution to Einstein’s equations at order a 2 , the contribution from higher order terms cannot be trusted. The multipole structure of the exterior solution (up to the second moment) is therefore similar to the Kerr metric (i.e. Mn = M (ia) n where Mn := ReMn and Jn := ImMn) except for the mass which is shifted at order a 2 and an additional quadrupole contribution. The mass shift is trivial and can be removed by adding to the above metric a perturbation of the form This shifts M0 back to M, leaving the rest of the moments unchanged. It can be checked that the metric in (2.10), with the above perturbation added to it, is a solution to Einstein’s vacuum equations. This metric represents the space time outside a rotating object of mass M and angular momentum aM. It has a quadrupole moment that is larger than a Kerr black hole by an amount proportional to (16q − 15p). 2.2 Inside the shell Now that we have a solution on the exterior, let us try to find a solution describing the interior of the bubble. The AdS metric can be written in global coordinates as  This separates out the angular dependence in Einstein’s equations (with cosmological constant Λ ≡ −3k) which can now be written as  0, (2.15) where primes denote derivatives with respect to r. We are looking for solutions to the above system of equations which vanish at the origin of the coordinate system. Imposing this boundary condition we can pick the following dϕ 2 , (2.17) where σi are functions of r and ϑ. Let us now choose the angular dependence of σi to be such that σ4 + σ3 ∼ P2(cos ϑ) and σ4 − σ3 ∼ sin2 ϑ. This is chosen so that the angular dependence separates out in Einstein’s equations.3 The radial parts for σ3 and σ4 are taken to be the same while the radial part of σ2 is chosen to be proporti 2 , (2.21) where µi and σi are given by (2.14) and (2.18) respectively with ci being arbitrary constants. Having set up the geometries inside and outside the bubble, we now need to match them across the shell by imposing continuity of the induced metric. We begin by working at first order in a, which serves to outline thann section 4. 3 First order in spin To lowest order in a, the exterior metric from the previous sect In the absence of rotation, i.e. a = 0, this is just the Schwarzschild case discussed in [16] with the shell positioned at R = 9M/4. For non-zero spin (a 6= 0), radius of the shell gets corrected at order a Let us now try to cast this in the form of a perfect fluid. The stress-energy tensor of a perfect fluid is given by S i j = (ρ + p) u iuj + pδi j , (3.8) where ρ and p are the density and pressure of the fluid, while u i is its velocity vector. Since the shell is made of high tension branes (with equation of state p = −ρ), a gas of open strings (with equation of state p = ρ/2) sitting on top of it and stiff matter (with equation of state p = ρ) made of D0 branes, the stress-energy tensor can be written as a sum of these three components. The total stress energy tensor in (3.7) should therefore be split into Stotal = Sbrane + Sgas + Sstiff, where for arbitrary constants mi and ni . Similar to the first order computation, we impose continuity of the induced metric across the shell by rescaling the time coordinate t˜ in terms of t and introducing a rotation ˜ϕ = ϕ + Ωt. This determines m1, m2, n2, c1 and c2, leaving three undetermined parameters n1, p and q. The first order expression for A in (3.4) receives a correction at order a 2 . Solutions to this first junction condition are listed in appendix A. The stress-energy tensor on the shell can now be computed from the jump in the extrinsic curvature across the shell i.e. (3.5). We find where Zi are functions involving constants and n1 (see appendix B). The velocity vector u i now has corrections of order a 2 over the first order result in (3.10) (see appendix B). We see that the stress-energy tensor from the first order computation in (3.9) gets corrected at order a 2 just as expected. We further notice that the angular dependence of the radius (governed by n2) goes as O  k −1  to leading order in k. This means that the shell is spherical for large k. The constants m1 and n1 are not determined by the junction conditions, and we have to make a further physical argument to fix the radius of the shell. A simple possibility is to assume that the total amount of fluid on the shell (which includes the gas and stiff matter) is conserved when the shell starts to rotate i.e  where rSchw and ρSchw are the radius and density of the fluid on the stationary black shell while rrot and ρrot are the corresponding quantities for the rotating shell. This determines n1 = −0.232/M2 + O  1/ √ k  , which fixes the radius a  up to leading order in k and we find that the shell shrinks a little. Density of the gas and the tension of the shell are shown in figure 1. It is interesting to note that although the radius of the shell is not fully determined by the junction conditions without further physical input beyond the equations of state, the quadrupole moment is fixed. It is independent of n1 and is uniquely given b  which is an increase of about 32% compared to that of a Kerr black hole with the same spin. We would like to point out two things here. Firstly, it is possible that energy is exchanged between the branes and the massless gas once the shell starts to spin. This would give a slightly different value for n1 and consequently r. Details of the string theory construction of the shell would give us the exact dynamics of these components and thus a way to fix the quantity n1. However, since the observable of interest i.e. the quadrupole moment does not depend on r, we do not explore this further. Secondly, it should also be noted that we have picked specific solutions to Einstein’s equations both in the interior and in the exterior of the shell that we then used to solve the junction conditions. These are not the only possible solutions, but none of the other solutions we investigated solved the junction conditions, given the physical properties of the shell that we assume. This indicates that our choice is the correct physical one. One would also expect on physical grounds that the metric outside the spinning shell is unique up to coordinate transformations One can compare this with the case of a compact object such as a neutron star, where the exterior metric is not expected to be described by the Kerr metric. The deviations from the Kerr metric, including a different quadrupole moment, are determined by the physical properties of the star. 5 Astrophysical implications Let us now discuss some observational implications of our proposal. Our model has no free parameters, and predicts specific observational signatures such as a significant increase in the quadrupole moment of about 32% compared to that of a Kerr black hole with the same spin. Our results are valid for small spins, but it is reasonable to speculate that the quadrupole moment would differ from that of the Kerr solution also at moderately large spins. This, however, might change when the spin approaches its maximal value. If the shell then approaches the would be horizon (as it does when the charge of a ReissnerNordstr¨om black hole is increased towards extremality [16]), the no-hair theorem could be restored, which would imply that the shift in the quadrupole moment vanishes as a → 1. We hope to generalize our results to arbitrary values of a in a future work. Although the spins of some black holes have been measured (see for example [38, 39]), it has, so far, not been possible to accurately measure the quadrupole moment. Luckily, this might change soon and we will discuss a few possibilities below. An obvious possibility would be through high precision measurements of the gravitational radiation emitted by colliding black holes. LIGO studies colliding stellar mass black holes, and will be able to measure the quadrupole moment with an accuracy of the order of the Kerr moment for higher spins. This suggests that it is unlikely for LIGO to reach the sensitivity required to test our model.6 LISA, on the other hand, focuses on super massive black holes and will reach much higher sensitivities. An analysis of the sensitivity of LIGO and LISA was given in [41] and it seems likely that measurements for LISA will be able to confirm or rule out our model. There are also other ways of constraining the quadrupole moments through astrophysical observations — one of them being the study of accretion discs around black holes. Infalling matter can migrate inwards, converting gravitational energy into kinetic energy and radiation, until it reaches the innermost stable orbit [42]. If it keeps falling beyond this orbit, it is rapidly captured by the black hole and no energy is released. The outcome is the same irrespective of whether one deals with a black hole or a black shell. The fraction of infalling matter which is converted to radiation (:= η) can be used as a measure of this efficiency. While the luminosity of accretion discs is easy to measure, the accretion rate is much harder to obtain. For instance, the black hole at the center of the galaxy has an efficiency no larger than η ∼ 5 · 10−6 [43]. The theoretical limit for the efficiency can be calculated from the effective potential and increases from η ∼ 0.057 for Schwarzschild to η ∼ 0.42 for a maximally spinning Kerr black hole.   where the corresponding pieces coming from Schwarzschild, Kerr and the quadrupole are identified above. An increase in the combination (16q − 15p) results in an increase of the quadrupole moment. Since the coefficient in front of this term in (5.1) is negative, an increase of the quadrupole moment results in a decrease in efficiency. However, since this coefficient is suppressed by an order of magnitude over the Kerr and Schwarzschild pieces, the decrease in efficiency is very small for slowly spinning black shells (∼ 0.05% for a = 0.1). Current estimates suggest η > 0.15 [23] as a lower limit and that a reasonable estimate for a mean value is η ∼ 0.30–0.35 [24]. As noted in [44], the observation of a single object with a high value of η(>∼ 0.42) would be enough to rule out the Kerr metric. The situation is the same for black shells. One should note that there are other mechanisms that power the Active Galactic Nucleus (AGN). Through the Blandford-Znajek (BZ) mechanism [45], the energy to power jets emanating from the AGN can be extracted from the rotational energy of the black hole. In this way the efficiency is no longer limited by the inflow of matter into the black hole, and can even exceed 1. The BZ mechanism is a version of the Penrose process [46] and mak use of the ergosphere surrounding a spinning black hole. Particles inside the ergosphere can have energies that are negative as measured from far away. In the Penrose process, a particle that enters the ergosphere splits into two, one of which has a negative energy and is captured by the black hole, while the other escapes with higher energy than the incoming one. In this way energy can be extracted from a spinning black hole without violating the laws of black hole thermodynamics since the reduction in energy is accompanied by a reduction in spin such that the area of the horizon increases. The BZ mechanism works in a similar way but makes use of electromagnetic fields instead of particles. The reason why an ergosphere is necessary in order to extract rotational energy by the above processes, is because of the nature of the black hole horizon. With an ordinary rotating object, one can extract energy by scattering particles against the rotating surface. If the particle hits the surface with a speed lower than the speed of rotation, it can simply scatter off with an increased speed and energy. However, if the rotating object is a black hole, such a scattering is not possible since there is no surface to scatter from and the particle is sucked into the horizon resulting in an increase rather than a decrease in the energy of the black hole. It works in the same way for black shells even though there is no horizon. As we have argued, the surface of the shell appears completely black due to the large number of degrees of freedom that effectively absorb anything that is incident on the shell (since it is entropically favorable). As a consequence, scattering off the shell is again of limited use if one wants to extract rotational energy from the shell. Hence, the use of an ergosphere is essential also in the case of a black shell. Since the shell starts out far outside of where the horizon (or even the ergosphere) would have been positioned, there is no ergosphere for a slowly spinning black shell. As the spin increases, we expect the shell to shrink in size. If there is an analogue to the case of charged black holes discussed in [16], we might expect the shell to approach the would be horizon as the spin becomes maximal. If this is true, there should exist a critical value of the spin a such that for higher values, an ergosphere (or a part of it) starts to appear outside the shell. A fully developed ergosphere is then expected to appear only in the limit of maximal spin. This should affect the efficiency of the BZ-mechanism as a function of the spin. In this context one needs to address the possibility of an ergosphere instability. It was argued in [47] that any object with an ergosphere, but without a horizon, is unstable. However, as discussed in [48], the essential feature of the horizon that removes the instability is that it effectively absorbs all incoming negative energy states. As the authors show, a compact object with an absorption coefficient as small as 1% can escape the instability. For our black shells, which are expected to be as efficient absorbers as real black holes, the ergosphere instability is therefore not an issue. A promising approach to measure the quadrupole moment with sufficient accuracy, is through the study of stars in close orbits around a black hole e.g. the black hole at the center of the Milky Way, coinciding with the radio source Sgr A*. For a review, see [49]. The orbit of a star will precess in the plane of the orbit, with frame dragging due to the spin as the dominating effect. In addition, the angular momentum of the orbit will precess with a rate that scales with the quadrupole moment. With the use of GRAVITY, an  interferometer on the Very Large Telescope (VLT), one hopes to be able to find, and study, stars with semi major axis of the order 1000GM/c 2 , and high eccentricity [50]. With two stars, and if they are bright enough, one can reach a sensitivity that could distinguish a black shell from a black hole. Even better, if one could find a pulsar with an orbital period of less than half a year, one should easily be able to exclude the existence of a black shell, and confirm the no-hair theorem with high accuracy. Another possibility, which could be close in time, is to study the shadow of the Sgr A* black hole using the Event Horizon Telescope. The black hole shadow has an asymmetry of order a 3 , and is therefore symmetric for all but the fastest spinning Kerr black holes. With a non-Kerr quadrupole moment, an extra term appears with the asymmetry of order a 2 , providing a way to measure deviations from the Kerr metric. Again, the expected accuracy is such that it might just be possible to distinguish a black shell from a black hole. There could also be other kinds of signals that could be used to distinguish between black shells and black holes. For instance, the presence of a hard surface outside of the horizon could lead to modifications of the gravitational waves emitted by colliding black holes, as discussed in [51–54]. To summarize, there are plenty of opportunities within the next few years to constrain models that replaces true black holes with horizonless structures such as the black shells. 6 Conclusions In this paper we have built on the proposal of [16] where it was suggested that the end point of gravitational collapse is not a black hole but rather a thin shell (enclosing a bubble of AdS space with a large negative cosmological constant) made out of branes from string theory with other stringy matter on top. We have generalized the construction to slowly rotating black shells that mimic black holes with low angular momentum. We have constructed explicit metrics describing space time in the interior and exterior of such shells, and have solved the junction conditions to find the shape of such objects. We found that the shells are spherical up to leading order in the cosmological constant k, even though the junction conditions allow for an indeterminacy of the radius at order a 2 . Further physical input is needed beyond the equations of state, and we suggest that the shell will actually shrink when it starts to rotate. Curiously enough, the quadrupole moment does not depend on this indeterminacy and is unique. It turns out to be about 32% larger than the corresponding value for a Kerr black hole with the same spin. We propose the modified value of the quadrupole moment as a test of our model, and expect that it should be possible to measure it with sufficient accuracy in the not too distant future. Promising methods include imaging of the black hole at the center of the Milky Way using the Event Horizon Telescope, precision measurements of stars in close orbits around the central black hole, and future observations of colliding super massive black holes using LISA. In order to make contact with the quadrupole moment of fast spinning black holes that might be observed astrophysically, the present work needs to be extended for arbitrary values of a.

21	2018	Discreteness of Black Hole Microstates	Gerard ’t Hooft	Discreteness of Black Hole Microstates Abstract It is explained that, for black holes much heavier than the Planck mass, black hole microstates can be well understood without string theory. It is essential to understand the antipodal identification at the horizon. We show why the microstates exhibit a discrete spectrum, and how they relate to the particles outside the hole. 1 The algebra leading to the microstates Consider a Schwarzschild black hole in a stationary situation, during a time interval O(MBH log MBH) in Planck units. Let it be surrounded by particles with masses and energies Ei ≪ MPlanck ≪ MBH , and densities in the range of that of Hawking particles. There are particles moving inwards and outwards. The black hole mass, MBH , fluctuates accordingly when particles are absorbed and emitted. During the given time interval these mass fluctuations are small compared to the entire black hole mass. Consequently, we can handle the black hole metric as a background metric, with minor perturbations described by perturbative (quantum) gravity [1]. This time-reversal symmetric situation is the best configuration for describing quantum energy eigen states, since these have the same time symmetry. String theory [2, 3] is claimed to account for these quantum states by appealing to pictures of stacks of Dbranes [4], fuzzballs [5] and other concoctions, while it appears to be almost impossible to reconstruct space-time itself, and the description of events as experienced by observers moving in or out, or to understand how unitarity is maintained in the black hole evolution. Where does quantum information go? In recent papers [1, 6] the author observed that, to get the picture right, one has to implement the gravitational back reaction between in- and out-states, and to impose the antipodal identification constraint. Disregarding these important insights inevitably leads to imprecise formulations. In contrast to claims often made, one cannot make the horizon disappear by becoming“fuzzy”, or believe that strings already take over at macroscopic distance scales, without serious damage to the concept of General Relativity. In a locally regular coordinate frame such as the Kruskal-Szekeres frame, the past event horizon is given by u + = 0, and the future event horizon is u − = 0, where u + and u − are local light cone coordinates. The most important region where most of the non-trivial physics takes place is the region where these two horizons intersect. This region is often portrayed as an S2 sphere, but we noticed [1] that it has to be replaced by a projective sphere, S2/Z2 . So, at the intersection, we identify antipodal points. The fact that the physical region is defined by r ≥ 2MBH implies that r never comes close to zero. Therefore, the Z2 identification never generates any physical singularity. As for the central singularity of the Schwarzschild black hole, it is well separated from the physical domain(s) by a horizon (cosmic censorship works fine here), so that it can do no harm. Particles entering the black hole, in-particles for short, may be represented by the momentum distribution, p −(θ, ϕ) that they deposit on the future event horizon. The out-particles can be characterised by their positions u −(θ, ϕ) when they leave the past event horizon. A condition for our information preservation process to work is that these operator distributions suffice to characterise all in-states and all out-states. There are good reasons to assume that this should work. In any case, these are the variables in terms of which we shall define all states, both for the particles deeply imbedded in the black hole1 and for the particles further outside. Outside observers never need to refer to particles ‘inside’ the black hole, that is, across any of the horizons. To describe the scattering matrix, we expand both u − and p − in spherical harmonics Yℓ m(θ, ϕ), turning them to variables u ± ℓ m and p ± ℓ m , obeying [u ∓ ℓ m, p± ℓ ′ m′] = i δℓ ℓ′ δm m′ , (1.2) The condition that the masses and the momenta of the particles are all demanded to stay below the Planck regime ensures that we need not worry about fluctuations of the space-time metric, but this does restrict the time period considered to stay well within the domain O(MBH log MBH). The earliest in-particles and the latest out-particles then develop momenta close to or beyond the Planck mass. These we now address by the back reaction equations [1]: The suffixes ‘(in)’ and ‘(out)’, are superfluous and will be omitted henceforth. The relations (1.2) — (1.4) do not allow us to restrict ourselves to the domain I , defined by (u + > 0, u− < 0), since the Fourier transform of a function supported by a domain x > 0 cannot be restricted to a domain p > 0. This is why region I cannot be considered separately from region II , defined by (u + < 0, u− > 0). Since both regions must be physical, we assume that region I refers to one hemisphere of the black hole only, while region II refers to the other hemisphere. It is the only way to keep the wave functions pure, while the condition that no cusp singularities are allowed makes this assignment unique. This is the antipodal identification [1]. We do see that, if |p − (in) ℓ,m | > ℓ 2 MPlanck , then the in-particle responsible for this large value of the momentum can be replaced by the associated out-particle, since its position now is far enough reparated from the point u − = 0 to be considered soft, as its momentum will always be in the order of the inverse of its position. 2 Discreteness Now, in region I , consider two dividing lines: u + = u1, u− = −u1 , and similarly region II , see Fig. 1. To count the quantum states, we consider all states on a Cauchy surface. Choose as our Cauchy surface a line such as the red line in Fig. 1. We see that then the complete set of quantum states is generated by the product of the states in regions A1, B1, B2 and A2 . This gives us all available quantum states3 . The states in regions A1 and A2 represent all particles outside the black hole. They form a continuum, since these domains are not compact. We shall be interested in the states in B1 and B2 . They may be regarded as states representing the microstates inside the black hole, although they are still physically within reach for the outside world. In earlier treatises, these states formed continua also. This is because u + and u − are tortoise coordinates: considering them as the exponents of regular coordinates, by writing u ± = σ ±e ̺ ± , one finds that ̺ + decreases linearly and ̺ − increases linearly in time. Since they are both unbounded below, the quantum states would seem to be continuous. This would have given us far too many micro-states, and furthermore, the particles moving inwards seemed to be unrelated to the ones going out (the black hole information paradox). In our treatise, due to the gravitational back reaction, which solves the information paradox, see Eqs. (1.3), this is different. We have for our microstates:   which is the domain of values where the angular momenta of the in- and out-particles is near the maximal value for capture by the black hole. Note, that in general, Hawking radiation is dominated by the lowest ℓ values; in the wave functions, higher ℓ is strongly suppressed. 3 Discussion There is an important caveat. In Eq. (2.1), it was assumed that large values for u1 would imply that particles are far separated from the horizon. We must be aware that we are actually discussing the (ℓ, m) component of the partial wave expansion. This expansion describes the positions as functions of θ and ϕ. In reality we should only attach one value set for θ and ϕ, not one value set for ℓ and m. Therefore, we should regard the above where β is the inverse Hawking temperature, E the energies of the states both in region I and region II , and n stands short for any other type of quantum numbers. For a local observer near the horizon, |ψiHH represents the single vacuum state, while for the distant observer it contains Hawking particles both going in and out. Averaging over the unseen states in region II gives us the thermal mixed states associated to Hawking’s temperature. His value for the entropy, as the logarithm of the number of microstates, follows directly. In our picture the precise interpretation is slightly different. When we are close to equilibrium, the two hemispheres of the black hole are entangled. An observer watching at most one hemisphere of the black hole (regardless in which orientation) will not notice the entanglement, and hence observe the same thermally mixed state. Now if the local observer sees a vacuum, the global observer actually sees the entangled state (3.1). The second hemisphere is entangled with the first, and hence the total number of microstates reached is strictly speaking only one, in practice better described as a combination of the states |E1, n1iI |E2, n2iII , which we also get when things are thrown into the hole. Far from equilibrium, the local observer will see particles moving in and out, different everywhere; the external observer should then see all the states. In the present paper, our only concern was to establish that the microstates should have a discrete spectrum; this we think we have demonstrated. There is the question of the cut-off ℓmax at high ℓ, which requires further exploration. At high ℓ the gravitational back reaction produces effects in the transverse directions, and the different ℓ, m partial waves begin to interact with one another. The non-gravitational interactions were ignored. In general quantum field theories, the couplings are weak, and they stay weak at the horizon, unlike the gravitational couplings. There are ways however to improve the argument, for instance by including gauge theory contributions. We do not expect these to substantially affect our conclusions. Needless to state that string theories and AdS/CFT conjectures were bypassed in our analysis. We are in 3+1 space-time dimensions, and have flat asymptotic space-time (Λ = 0). There is no need for supersymmetry, and there is no need to go to the BCS limit, where horizons are quite different from the more representative Schwarzschild case (in the BCS limit, the Cauchy horizon and the event horizon almost coincide, to form a structure that is quite different from an ordinary event horizon). No exotic assumptions had to be made to understand the gravitational back reaction, and, although the antipodal identification is an assumption, it is a natural assumption concerning space-time topology 6 that does not violate causality and actually restores unitarity for the black hole. It is the only way to avoid cusp singularities at the horizon. As we only considered black holes close to equilibrium, the question how antipodal identification switches on in the black hole formation process was not answered, but we may assume that this will be genuine Planckian physics that is not yet understood. Note that, when a black hole forms, the horizon starts out as almost a single point, where ‘antipodal identification’ would only span Planckian distance scales. 	Abstract It is explained that, for black holes much heavier than the Planck mass, black hole microstates can be well understood without string theory. It is essential to understand the antipodal identification at the horizon. We show why the microstates exhibit a discrete spectrum, and how they relate to the particles outside the hole.
22	2019	Thermodynamics of 4D Dilatonic Black Holes and the Weak Gravity Conjecture	Gregory J. Loges,a Toshifumi Noumib and Gary Shiua	Thermodynamics of 4D Dilatonic Black Holes and the Weak Gravity Conjecture Abstract: Taking a thermodynamic perspective, we study the weak gravity conjecture in the context of 4D Einstein-Maxwell-dilaton theory. We find closed-form expressions for the corrected thermodynamic quantities in the presence of four-derivative terms in the action, and in particular the charge-to-mass ratio and entropy, for several families of solutions of special magnetic-to-electric charge ratio or dilaton coupling constant. Assuming that dyonic black holes themselves are the conjectured charged states, this places constraints on the Wilson coefficients of the theory which we show are satisfied under mild assumptions on the UV theory.  1 Introduction Classically, black holes have a well-defined temperature and thermodynamic entropy and are the source of several puzzles, such as the information paradox and the origin of their area-law entropy. String theory has offered explanations and explicit microscopic counting of states which give rise to the area-dependence for these solutions [1], a property which is seemingly mysterious when viewed from the perspective of classical Einstein gravity. Similarly, questions surrounding the infinite-density singularities of the classical theory are expected to be resolved by higher-energy physics, be it through stringy or, more generally, quantum gravity effects. One may systematically characterize these effects using the techniques of effective field theory, where a derivative expansion captures those features of the UV theory which are relevant for lower-energy processes. Of course, the challenge is to sum over the infinitely many higher derivative corrections in situations where this is necessary, such as in addressing the aforementioned cosmic singularities. String theory provides a UV complete framework in which such summation can at least in principle be carried out, as manifest e.g. in the Regge behavior of string scattering amplitudes. Black holes also feature in the swampland program [2], where they play a central role in thought experiments which provide a motivation for the weak gravity conjecture (WGC) [3]. For a recent review of the swampland program, including the WGC, see [4, 5]. The WGC states that effective theories which have a UV completion including gravity must contain a state with charge-to-mass ratio greater than one, in appropriate units. It was quickly noted that black holes themselves may satisfy the conjecture if higher-derivative corrections increase the charge-to-mass ratio of extremal black hole states from their classical value of one [6]. For black holes at least, the WGC is equivalent to requiring that two identical extremal black holes repel one another, and hence have the decay to smaller black holes being kinematically allowed (in general the WGC and “Repulsive Force Conjecture” are not equivalent [7], but such distinction is not relevant for our discussion). In 4D with Coulombic forces, this becomes  It is natural to extend these arguments to Einstein-Maxwell-dilaton (EMd) theory, which arises as the low-energy theory of both KK reduction and string theory. With a massless dilaton the low-energy effective theory now includes more degrees of freedom than Einstein-Maxwell theory, and one cannot integrate out the dilaton to work in an EFT of only gravitons and photons. In this paper, we leverage the thermodynamic properties of black holes to derive bounds on the Wilson coefficients of the low-energy effective theory for several important EMd black hole solutions and show that the bounds are satisfied under generic assumptions on the UV theory. This paper is organized as follows. In section 2 we review 4D EMd black holes solutions and their thermodynamics. In section 3 we outline the technique used to extract higher-derivative corrections to all thermodynamic quantities. In section 4 we present the corrections to the charge-to-mass ratio and entropy which are relevant for the WGC. In section 5 we show that the derived bounds are indeed satisfied under mild assumptions on the UV theory, and we conclude in section 6. 2 Review of Einstein-Maxwell-dilaton Black Hole Solutions We begin by reviewing static, dyonic black hole solutions of 4D EMd theory, for which we write the action as  Here and in what follows we use the compact notation (∂φ) 2 = ∂µφ∂µφ and (F 2 ) = FµνF µν . Going forward we will set M2 Pl = 1/8πGN = 1. The exponential coupling constant, λ, may take on any real value, and it will be convenient to introduce the associated constant h = 2 1+2λ2 ∈ (0, 2]. Several special values for λ are of note: λ = 0 (h = 2) gives EinsteinMaxwell theory with a decoupled dilaton; λ 2 = 1/2 (h = 1) corresponds to the low-energy effective action of string theory; λ 2 = 3/2 (h = 1/2) corresponds to the KK reduction of Einstein gravity from 5D to 4D, where the radion plays the role of the dilaton. The action/equations of motion of (2.1) enjoy two dualities  where Feµν ≡ 1 2 e −2λφµνρσF ρσ. Under the second duality, which we refer to as electromagnetic duality, electric and magnetic charges are interchanged as (qe, qm) → (qm, −qe). A spherically-symmetric, static solution of the equations of motion is [12, 13]  Imposing the boundary conditions Hα → 1 for r → ∞ and Hα > 0 for r → 2ξ, this solution is well-behaved outside the outer horizon, r > 2ξ. For convenience we have set φ∞ = 0; a constant shift to φ is compensated for by a rescaling of the electric and magnetic charges. While closed-form solutions of equation (2.7) do not exist for general λ, one can show that series solutions of the form Along with equation (2.7), this allows one to solve for the coefficients P (k) α order-by-order in terms of P (1) α , ξ, h and the qα alone. The entire series is then fixed by prescribing a physical parameter, such as the mass or temperature. In section 4 we will focus only on those cases where the functions Hα take a particularly manageable form.2 2.1 Physical Parameters and Extremality In writing down the solution to the equations of motion we have introduced the parameters ξ, P (k) e and P (k) m ; we would like to interpret these in terms of the physical properties of the black hole. Ultimately the full solution may be determined by specifying only the black hole’s charges and temperature. Metric singularities occur at r = 0 and r = 2ξ, which set the locations of the horizons. Extremality thus corresponds to the limit ξ → 0, and requiring the regularity of the Euclidean section at the outer horizon gives the black hole temperature as  where the constants Ah and W may be fixed by a gauge choice. From this we may read off the black hole’s (gauge-invariant) electric potential and the analogous magnetic potential relative to infinity,   where we have introduced the rescaled charges Qα = 4πqα; we will use both qα and Qα throughout the remaining sections. Very nicely, the above expression for the mass is independent of the coupling λ. Note, however, that Qφ = −4πhλ(P (1) e − P (1) m ) is not an independent parameter; in particular, one always has M2 > 0. In the extremal limit ξ → 0 the WGC bound (1.2) is saturated, but it remains to be seen whether higher-derivative corrections will decrease the mass and lead to a strict inequality, or increase the mass and lead to such black holes not satisfying the bound. To have a controlled classical solution on which to consider higher-derivative corrections we should require T < ∞ and S > 0 at extremality. Pure electric or magnetic black holes have vanishing area for any h 6= 2, and in fact have diverging temperature if h < 1, so that we will have to treat these cases with care. The curiosity of infinite-temperature black holes was pursued in [14], where it was argued that one should morally think of these solutions as elementary particles and that while the temperature is formally infinite, the rate of thermal radiation emission does go to zero as a result of an infinite mass gap. A qualitative difference between the h < 1 and h > 1 regimes for single-charge black holes was also found in [15] when considering connections between the weak gravity conjecture and cosmic censorship. 3 Euclidean Action and Thermodynamics 3.1 Outline of General Procedure Thermodynamic ideas have recently been pursued in calculating corrections to extremal black holes’ charge-to-mass or angular momentum-to-mass ratio [16–18]. Here we outline how one may use the Euclidean action to compute thermodynamic quantities, and in particular their higher-derivative corrections, for any finite temperature black hole solution. For a recent thorough discussion, see [17]. We are ultimately interested in extremal black holes, and so when executing the described procedure we will find it convenient to work with the temperature as an expansion parameter Following the usual procedure, temporarily restrict attention to r < R when making a Wick rotation to Euclidean time, (it) ∼ (it) + β, with β = 1/T the inverse temperature. Eventually the R → ∞ limit will be taken. The action in equation (2.1) does not lead to a well-posed variational problem; boundary terms are required to ensure that the action is stationary under all variations of the metric and vector potential which vanish on ∂M. The appropriate choice is to include a Gibbons-Hawking-York (GHY) term, which leads to  where K is the trace of the extrinsic curvature on ∂M. Since the GHY term at r = R diverges in the infinite-volume limit we have subtracted off the analogous quantity for flat space, K0, to regularize the action and ensure that it remains finite in the infinite-volume limit. The action I R E,0 is invariant under all variations of the metric which vanish on ∂M. In addition, the appropriate boundary conditions for the Maxwell field are to prescribe Ak on the boundary, i.e. fix the electric potential at the horizon and the magnetic charge. This may be seen by rewriting the Maxwell term  .2) The surface term is invariant under variations of the 4-potential which vanish at the horizon, which amounts to fixing At and Aϕ. Thus when working directly with the Euclidean action it is appropriate to work in the grand canonical ensemble, in which the temperature, electric potential and magnetic charge are the independent quantities [19, 20]. After having regularized the boundary term at r = R we may safely take the infinitevolume limit and con (3.5) where G is the free energy. Importantly, this relationship between the free energy and Euclidean action remains true even when higher-derivative corrections are included, as long as S is taken to be the Wald entropy [21]. Using the fir 3.2 Higher-Derivative Corrections Effective theories allow one to systematically parametrize the effects of UV physics in terms of a small number of numerical coefficients. The values of these Wilson coefficients are determined by the UV theory, up to field redefinitions. In string frame we assume an action of the form B, rather than W2 , so that we may more easily compare with previous Einstein-Maxwell results in the λ → 0 limit where the Gauss-Bonnet term becomes topological. Note that the first duality of equation (2.2) is maintained, while the electromagnetic duality is broken. We will treat electric and magnetic solutions separately in section 4. Upon adding these higher-derivative terms the equations of motion which need to be solved are altered, leading to perturbed solutions for g, A and φ. We favor, however, a thermodynamic approach which has recently been used in [17] and [18]. Equations (3.5) and (3.7) are used along with the following fa where IE,i denote the Euclidean versions of the terms in the four-derivative action, equation (3.9). One may then transition to different ensembles, as outlined in figure 1, by inverting to leading order in αi . The weak gravity conjecture is directly a statement about the charge-to-mass ratio in the canonical ensemble, where at fixed temperature (T = 0) we expect Q/M ∼ zext > 1. One also expects that at fixed mass and charge, the entropy of z = 1 black holes increases in the presence of higher derivative corrections. Using standard thermodynamic manipulations, the corrections to the entropy in the microcanonical ensemble are3 4 Mass and Entropy Corrections We turn now to the execution of the procedure outlined in section 3. There are several special choices of the exponential coupling constant and/or charges for which equation (2.7) is exactly solvable. We will use five such closed-form solutions of equation (2.7) which allow us to calculate corrections analytically; (i) pure magnetic, (ii) pure electric, (iii) equalcharge, (iv) dyonic with string theory coupling (h = 1), and (v) dyonic with 5D KK reduction coupling (h = 1/2). Corrections to the mass for the case of the magneticallycharged Garfinkle-Horowitz-Strominger black hole (h = 1) have been computed in [22]. See figure 2 for the complete parameter space. In presenting the following consistency conditions, it is worth noting that α3 and α4 are small when gravitational effects are negligible, and that unitarity of the S-matrix requires that α1, α2, α5 and α7 are all positive. We will discuss these statements further in section 5. It is convenient to introduce the following notation when discussing corrections in the canonical ensemble:  4.1 Magnetic The simplest case for our purpose is the magnetically charged black hole, as here Φ = Qe = 0 and what we call the grand canonical and canonical ensembles are one and the same. With Qe = 0, equation (2.7) has solutions 4.2 Electric For a massless dilaton the classical solution has We have checked that running the thermodynamic procedure reproduces the same leadingorder corrections as integrating out φ at tree-level. The Wilson coefficients for the resulting Einstein-Maxwell theory are   4.3 Dyonic, Qe = Qm For black holes of equal electric and magnetic charges the equations of motion have the following solutio 4.4 Dyonic, h = 1 For λ 2 = 1/2 (h = 1) the exponential coupling corresponds to that found in the low-energy effective action of string theory. Here we consider dyonic solutions, for which the extremal limit is T → 0. Equation (2.7) has for solutions 4.5 Dyonic, h = 1/2 With λ 2 = 3/2 (h = 1/2) the exponential coupling corresponds to the KK reduction of Einstein gravity on M4 × S 1 , with the radion playing the role of the dilaton. In this case equation (2.7) has for solutions where the functions Mi(ζ) are plotted in figure 4: the expressions are left to appendix A. Despite the functional form of the Mi being quite different from those of the Mi , there is a striking similarity between their behavior as ζ varies. From these mass corrections, we obtain the consistency condition required by the weak gravity conjecture: 4.6 Comments on Entropy Corrections In all of the cases considered above we have found entropy corrections to extremal black holes which are not O(αi), which we may interpret as arising from the stretching of the black hole horizon. For example, before the introduction of higher-derivative corrections the dyonic, h = 1 case at extremality has i.e. the degenerate horizon is at r = 0. O(αi) corrections to f(r) lead to ∆r ∼ √ αi . In our thermodynamic approach the temperature is tied to the separation between the two horizons via equation (2.10), and so we are still able to capture this square-root behavior in equation (4.51) even without computing perturbations to the metric. We may reconcile these observations with equation (3.17) by noting that IE,i(M, Qe, Qm) often diverges as (z − 1)−1/2 , so that one must go to the next order in αi , z = 1 + O(αi), to achieve a finite answer. The O(α 2−h i ) behavior in the magnetic case stems from f(r) not being quadratic near r = 0 when h < 2. 5 The Weak Gravity Conjecture Having obtained consistency conditions on the Wilson coefficients of the higher-derivative terms for EMd theory, we now turn to the task of showing that these conditions are satisfied under generic assumptions on the UV theory. For this discussion we find it useful to reinstate factors of MPl. Before moving to particular examples, it is worth noting that renormalization group effects from graviton, photon and dilaton loops lead to the running of the αi . These Wilson coefficients have dimensions which may be computed perturbatively, with only one or more being most important as one runs to the deep IR. Presently, however, we will show that for a number of generic UV completions of the EMd EFT the weak form of the WGC holds. 5.1 Unitarity Assuming that gravitational effects are subdominant, unitarity requires that both α1 and α2 be non-negative. Here we will show that a similar condition applies also to α5 and α7:  We use the spinning polynomial basis, P 1234 sn (x), of [25] and assume that no exchanged particles are massless. Factorization implies the following form for two of the forward helicity amplitudes:  It is interesting to note that the positivity of α7 implies a contribution from α7(∂φ∂φF F) to the charge-to-mass ratio which is always negative. Conceivably this contribution to z could dominate and lead to a violation of the WGC. This shows that in general unitarity of the S-matrix is not sufficient to ensure that the weak form of the WGC holds. This is similar to the situation in [10], where fine-tuning of non-minimal couplings allows for the possibility of violating the WGC when running the Wilson coefficients into the deep IR, but this is not borne out in examples. 5.2 Neutral Scalars In the EMd EFT the graviton, photon and dilaton are all massless. In UV completions for which the next-lightest fields are neutral (pseudo)scalars, integrating out these fields at tree-level generates nonzero α1, α2, α5 and α6. Specifically, if one has 5.3 Charged Scalars and Fermions If the lowest-lying states in the UV theory are charged scalars and/or fermions, then the leading contributions to the αi are generated by one-loop diagrams, such as those in figure 5. Assuming weak coupling at the scale of these charged states, we need consider only electrically-charged particles. Writing z ∼ qe m for the charge-to-mass ratio of such a particle, we may estimate 5.4 Open String-like UV Completion Suppose now that the UV theory has no low-lying states, but rather towers of higher-spin, Regge states accompanying the graviton, photon and dilaton. Writing ΛQFT < MPl for the scale at which quantum field theory breaks down, one would expect the following hierarchy: By itself such a hierarchy is not enough to guarantee that the WGC conditions are satisfied, even if supplemented with α1, α2, α5, α7 ≥ 0. While the contributions to the charge-tomass ratio from the α1, α2 and α5 terms are always positive, the α7 contribution is always negative and the α6 contribution changes sign with ζ larger or smaller than one. It is enough, however, to have Such an inequality is found in open string-like UV completions, where the Regge states of the photon are open string states, while the Regge states of the graviton and dilaton are closed string states. Since gs ∼ g 2 open, the contributions from each sector to the Wilson coefficients are then 5.5 The Heterotic String Here we quickly check that the Wilson coefficients derived from compactifying heterotic string theory down to 4D satisfy the conditions found for h = 1. In string frame the O(α 0 ) heterotic string action reads [26]   6 Discussion In this paper we have calculated higher-derivative corrections to Einstein-Maxwell-dilaton black holes for a variety of choices for electric charge, magnetic charge and dilaton coupling constant. Motivated by the swampland program and the weak gravity conjecture in particular, we found constraints on the Wilson coefficients of the effective theory which ensure that the charge-to-mass ratio of black holes increases from its classical value. For electrically charged black holes perturbative control is lost due to the classically vanishing area and diverging dilaton at extremality. By considering several generic UV completions of EMd theory we have shown that the consistency conditions imposed by the WGC are generically satisfied. These checks show that the charge-to-mass ratio of extremal, dilatonic black holes increases from its classical value for a range of electric, magnetic and dyonic solutions. We have focused on those cases where we can obtain closed-form expressions, but much of the parameter space remains unchecked. For dyonic black holes and general coupling λ, one could check numerically that similar results hold. Given the similarity of the h = 1 and h = 1/2 cases, we expect that nothing drastically different would be found for general h. Our work provides more nontrivial evidence for the WGC as a general constraint for identifying quantum gravity-derived EFTs. Even in this more general setting all large black holes are unstable to decay, either through thermal radiation if at finite temperature or through the kinematically allowed emission of a superextremal black hole. For the heterotic string, the weak form of the WGC pursued here is connected via modular invariance to a strong form where the superextremal states are light [27] Refs. [10] and [11] have recently shown that one-loop contributions to the Wilson coefficients generically lead to the weak form of the WGC being satisfied in the deep IR. It would be interesting to investigate this argument with the exponential coupling of the dilaton considered here. In addition, our setup can also be extended to a supersymmetric one by including an axion in addition to the dilaton. In the absence of non-perturbative effects the SL(2, R) symmetry leads to all dyonic solutions having vanishing classical area, as we had here in the pure electric and magnetic cases. We leave such considerations for future work. We conclude with a comment on the difficulty of demonstrating the WGC using positivity bounds for scattering amplitudes. The main obstruction to deriving the mild WGC from the positivity bounds is the t-channel graviton exchange ∼ s 2/t. In [8] it was clarified under which conditions the positivity of the O(s 2 ) coefficient is justified and thus the mild WGC follows by carefully studying contributions from Regge states. More recently, Ref. [9] proposed a regularization scheme based on compactification of 4D gravitational theory to 3D. Even though it was claimed that it leads to the O(s 2 ) positivity and thus the mild WGC in general setups, several big assumptions are in order: First of all, to remove the t-channel singularity in their scenario, one needs to take the forward limit t → 0 first and then take the decompactification limit, which is an opposite ordering to obtaining the 4D bound. Second, this scenario is motivated by a potential non-perturbative UV completion of 3D gravity [28–31]. However, it is far from obvious if the same scenario works in the 3D gravitational theory with a 4D origin. For example, if we assume a perturbative UV completion of gravity just as sting theory, the KK reduced 3D theory will contain infinitely many higher-spin Regge states. As demonstrated in [8], the standard derivation of the positivity bounds [32] cannot be justified unless effects of the Regge states are subdominant. Therefore, more studies on Regge states will be encouraged to understand how to resolve the t-channel singularity and complete the proof of the mild WGC, at least as long as we consider the string theory type UV completion of gravity.

23	2018	Adding new branches to the “Christmas tree” of the quasinormal spectrum of black branes	Saˇso Grozdanova and Andrei O. Starinetsb	Adding new branches to the “Christmas tree” of the quasinormal spectrum of black branes Abstract: In holography, quasinormal spectra of black branes coincide with the poles of retarded finite-temperature correlation functions of a dual quantum field theory in the limit of infinite number of relevant degrees of freedom such as colours. For asymptotically antide Sitter backgrounds, the spectra form a characteristic pattern in the complex frequency plane, colloquially known as the “Christmas tree”. At infinite coupling, the tree has only one pair of branches. At large but finite coupling, the branches become more dense and lift up towards the real axis, consistent with the expectation of forming a branch cut in the limit of zero coupling. However, it is known that at zero coupling, the corresponding correlators generically have not one but multiple branch cuts separated by intervals proportional to the Matsubara frequency. This suggests the existence of multiple branches of the “Christmas tree” spectrum in dual gravity. In this note, we show numerically how these additional branches of the spectrum can emerge from the dual gravitational action with higher-derivative terms. This phenomenon appears to be robust, yet, reproducing the expected weak coupling behaviour of the correlators quantitatively implies the existence of certain constraints on the coefficients of the higher-derivative terms of the dual gravity theory.  1 Introduction Quasinormal spectra of black branes play an important role in studies of strongly interacting thermal quantum field theories (QFTs) via gauge-gravity duality methods. In the early days of the duality exploration, it was pointed out that small fluctuations of Einstein-Hilbert gravity backgrounds with event horizons should correspond to thermalisation processes in the dual QFTs at infinitely strong coupling [1, 2], and in fact it was noticed that the spectrum of the BTZ black brane coincides with the location of the poles of the retarded correlators in a dual (infinitely strongly coupled) two-dimensional CFT [3]. With the recipe for computing the Minkowski space correlators from dual gravity established, this connection was shown to be a generic consequence of the gauge-string duality conjecture [4]. This was further explored in refs. [5–7] and subsequent publications [8]. Quasinormal modes of black branes in five dimensions, dual to four-dimensional thermal QFTs, typically obey differential equations of the Heun type [5], whose generic analytic solution is unknown. A rare analytic example in 4d is provided by the retarded two-point correlator function GR JJ (ω, q) of the R-currents in N = 4 supersymmetric SU(Nc) YangMills (SYM) theory in the limit of infinite Nc and infinite ‘t Hooft coupling λ = g 2 Y M Nc. At zero spatial momentum, all components of the correlator are proportional to [9]  These are precisely the quasinormal modes of the dual AdS-Schwarzschild black brane background [6]. At q 6= 0, the quasinormal spectra with wn = wn(q) of this and other correlators, now found numerically, have a similar pattern in the complex w−plane, colloquially known as the “Christmas tree” (see figure 1). At zero ‘t Hooft coupling, the structure of singularities of retarded thermal correlators is very different: at q 6= 0, they are branch points1 rather than poles2 [10, 15] (see figure 1). In position space, this corresponds to the qualitatively different late time dependence of the correlators at weak coupling in comparison to strong coupling. When the coupling is increased from zero (decreased from infinity), we expect the singularity structures shown in the left and right panels of figure 1 to transform into each other, respectively. On the strong coupling side, lowering the coupling from infinity corresponds to taking into account string theory α 0 corrections to the dual gravity background. However, it was argued in ref. [10] that perturbative α 0 corrections cannot alter the character of the quasinormal spectrum qualitatively: the singularities remain isolated poles, and the branch points do not appear. Numerical investigations in ref. [16] of the singularities of thermal energy-momentum tensor correlator via dual gravity with higher-derivative terms treated perturbatively were consistent with those expectations: the poles in the right panel of figure 1 just move up slightly and non-uniformly3 under the influence of the higher-derivative perturbation. Perturbative treatment of higher-derivative terms in dual gravity is a necessity for two reasons. First, only a few such structures out of an infinite series of corrections in increasing powers of α 0 are known explicitly in the low energy string theory actions. Thus, any result beyond an infinitesimally small leading-order correction is potentially affected by the contributions coming from the unknown terms. Second, theories with higher derivatives, if treated non-perturbatively, generically suffer from the Ostrogradsky instability and related pathologies. The second problem can be alleviated, at least at first sight, for Lovelock gravity (in particular, for Gauss-Bonnet gravity), where the equations of motion are of second order. The first problem cannot disappear but can be perceived as less acute if one is only interested in a qualitative pattern of behaviour, provided such a pattern is stable. In this case, equations of motion are reduced to second-order ones perturbatively in some  relevant small dimensionless parameter γ but their solution is found without assuming γ  1. Such a “partial resummation” [17] cannot be fully quantitatively correct beyond the limit of small γ as it misses potential contributions from terms of order γ 2 and higher in the action, and those contributions may be significant [19], but qualitatively, the emerging pattern of the spectrum appears to be robust. Crucially, this approach allows to uncover parts of the spectrum hidden at complex infinity in the limit γ → 0 [18]. This is very well illustrated by considering the spectrum of Gauss-Bonnet black branes, where perturbative and non-perturbative regimes can be reliably compared [20]. The analysis of the quasinormal spectra of black branes in 5d Gauss-Bonnet gravity and α 0 -corrected type IIB supergravity [18, 20] revealed a generic qualitative pattern for the behaviour of the thermal spectrum shown in figure 2 (right panel). At large but finite coupling (small but finite γ), the two branches of poles lift up towards the real axis; the real parts of the top-most poles approach the values of ±q; the poles of the correlator also become more dense and interlaced with zeros (this last feature is not shown in figure 2) which appears to be a characteristic feature consistent with the formation of a branch cut [11]. In addition, there are extra poles on the imaginary axis coming up from below as the coupling is lowered from infinity [18]. One may be prepared to believe that with the coupling decreasing all the way to zero, the dense sequence of poles in the right panel of figure 2 gradually approaches the top branch cut shown in the left panel. But where do the other cuts in the left panel of figure 2 come from? And where do the poles on the imaginary axis go then? Similar questions exist for correlators at q = 0 (see section 3). In this note, we show that the missing cuts can come from adding more higherderivative terms to the gravity action. We find that at large but finite coupling, the standard “Christmas tree” of the quasinormal spectrum has more than just one pair of branches (in fact, we expect an infinite number of branches to appear with the full series of higher-derivative terms taken into account but as a proof of principle, we only consider one additional pair of branches in this paper). The new branches of the “Christmas tree” emerge as a result of complicated dynamics and collisions of poles on the imaginary axis. The phenomenon of two poles colliding and splitting off the imaginary axis is known in holography, mostly in the context of models with finite chemical potential and finite temperature (see e.g. [21–24]). The same phenomenon is responsible for the breakdown of the hydrodynamic description at sufficiently large, coupling-dependent spatial momentum [18, 20] (see also [25, 26]).4 Here, this mechanism leads to the formation of the extra branches of the “Christmas tree” spectrum, as we describe below. 2 New branches of the quasinormal spectrum in higher-derivative gravity We consider the bulk 5d gravity action with higher-derivative terms organised as a power series of the Riemann tensor squared, truncated at second order, where |α|  1 is a book-keeping parameter reminiscent of α 0 in string theory. This choice of the action is partially motivated by simplicity and partially by experience with field redefinitions and their role in computing thermodynamic and transport coefficients in theories with higher-derivative terms [28–31]. All dimensionful quantities will be measured in units set by the cosmological constant Λ = −6/L2 . Without loss of generality, we set γ1 = 1 and L = 1 in the following, unless noted otherwise. The equations of motion corresponding to the action (2.1) possess a black brane background solution with the metric of the form   where f(r) and h(r) can be found perturbatively in the small α expansion We are interested in computing the quasinormal spectrum of gravitational fluctuations of the background (2.2) and studying its dependence on the parameters of the action. We follow the standard procedure of decomposing the metric fluctuations hµν into symmetry classes [4, 7, 18, 32] and, for simplicity, focus on the scalar channel fluctuations hxy. To order O(α 2 ), and with the higher-derivative terms eliminated at the expense of generating O(α 3 ) terms as explained in refs. [18, 33], the equation of motion for the metric fluctuation component hxy(r) = r 2Z(r), represented in terms of Fourier modes ∼ e −iωt+iqz, can be written as 17) At α = 0, the quasinormal spectrum wn of eq. (2.11) (shown in the left panel of figure 3) coincides with the known spectrum of the AdS-Schwarzschild black brane [5]. Analogously, at α 6= 0 and γ2 = 0, we recover the spectrum qualitatively similar to the one found for black branes in Gauss-Bonnet gravity and AdS-Schwarzschild background corrected by R4 terms [18, 20, 33]. This spectrum is shown in the right panel of figure 3 for several values of α. Note the presence of the new modes on the imaginary axis, as described in the Introduction. The scalar channel has no hydrodynamic modes on the imaginary axis (or elsewhere), and the new poles can move up unobstructed. The same modes are responsible for the transport peak in the spectral function of a dual thermal QFT at large but finite coupling  A new phenomenon arises at order O(α 2 ), i.e. when γ1 6= 0 and γ2 6= 0 in the action (2.1). Here, in addition to the standard “Christmas tree” branches, the spectrum again exhibits multiple new poles on the imaginary axis (figure 4, top-left panel). The distance between the new poles depends on the ratio γ2/γ1. Changing this ratio, one observes pair-wise collisions of the poles (figure 4, top-right and bottom-left panels), leading to them “splitting off” the imaginary axis (figure 4, bottom-right panel). These multiple collisions eventually result in forming a new pair of symmetric branches in the “Christmas tree” spectrum, as shown in figure 5. This behaviour appears to be robust with respect to changing the parameters of the action (2.1), as well as changing the value of the spatial momentum q. The bottom-right panel of figure 5 is, in a sense, the main result of this paper: it demonstrates how new branches of poles in the quasinormal spectrum (expected in the dual QFT at finite coupling) can emerge from the higher-derivative terms in the gravitational action. We note that tuning the ratio γ2/γ1 should not be thought of as changing the coupling constant of the dual theory, but rather as changing the strength of subleading coupling-dependent corrections. From the point of view of supergravity, parameters such as γ1 and γ2 are determined by the graviton scattering amplitudes, while we think of α as being the analog of α 0 in string theory. We have also observed two other, qualitatively different, regimes that the spectrum can exhibit. One is shown in figure 6, where we fix the parameter γ2 at the same value as in the bottom-right panel of figure 5, γ2 = 0.05, and change α at q = 0. Here, for sufficiently large α, the second pair of branches formed by the same mechanism of the imaginary axis pole collisions, “goes up and through” the first pair of branches, eventually crossing into the upper half-plane of complex frequency thus developing a fatal instability. This simply means that not all ratios of the parameters in the action (2.1) are physically allowed, assuming the action serves as a dual gravity description of a stable thermal QFT. Yet another pattern of the quasinormal spectrum following from the action (2.1) is shown in figure 7. For negative γ2 and q = 0, we observe the emergence of a large number of poles on the imaginary axis without the formation of the two extra branches of the “Christmas tree”.  3 Thermal retarded correlators at q = 0 At zero coupling, finite-temperature retarded two-point functions GR(w, q = 0) in 4d have poles rather than branch cuts in the complex frequency plane. For example, for bosonic degrees of freedom, we have [10] where ψ(z) is again the logarithmic derivative of the Gamma function and P(z) is a polynomial of degree less than four. Singularities of the correlator (3.1) are simple poles located  on the imaginary axis with periodicity |w| = 2, as shown in the left panel of figure 8. At infinite coupling, the same correlator has poles that are still arranged in the “Christmas tree” pattern, similar, although not identical to the q 6= 0 spectrum (figure 8, right panel). When a higher-derivative term is added to the dual gravity action (one may consider e.g. the action (2.1) with γ1 6= 0 and γ2 = 0), the spectrum changes similarly to what is shown in the right panel of figure 2: the two branches of poles move up and become more dense (and interlaced with zeros), and new poles appear on the imaginary axis. Adding another higher-derivative term to the action with the right coefficients can result in the spectrum shown in figure 7. We may speculate that in the limit of vanishing coupling, the two branches of the original “Christmas tree” form a branch cut along the entire real w-axis (rather than the two cuts at q 6= 0 shown in the left panel of figure 1), with vanishing discontinuity and the only singularity remaining at infinity. Such a branch cut is a contractible cycle on the Riemann sphere, which can be ignored. Furthermore, the poles on the imaginary axis are re-arranged to form the pattern shown in the left panel of figure 8. 4 Discussion We have seen that adding generic, modulo field redefinitions, higher-derivative terms to the Einstein-Hilbert gravity action can result in the emergence of new branches of quasinormal modes in the spectrum of black branes. This is qualitatively similar to the expected behaviour of dual thermal QFTs at finite coupling. Although our discussion has been necessarily qualitative and descriptive throughout, we believe it is important to point out that the potential mechanism of reconciling the two panels of figure 1 exists in holography. The parameter space of the higher-derivative coefficients we are considering in this note is two-dimensional. Quantitatively, even in this simple case, we seem to have a continuum of possibilities for the resulting spectrum, yet, qualitatively, we observe only three standard patterns according to which the poles arrange themselves. If the emerging qualitative picture is indeed correct, and assuming monotonicity of the coupling dependence, this implies that the coefficients of the higher derivative terms in the dual action must lie within certain highly constrained intervals in order for the finite-temperature theory to have an expected behaviour at weak coupling. This is similar to the constraint on the ratio of shear viscosity to entropy density emerging from the expected behaviour in kinetic theory [18]. It would be highly desirable to understand the analytic structure of real-time finitetemperature correlators of composite operators at weak but non-vanishing coupling beyond the results obtained in refs. [11–14].	Abstract: In holography, quasinormal spectra of black branes coincide with the poles of retarded finite-temperature correlation functions of a dual quantum field theory in the limit of infinite number of relevant degrees of freedom such as colours. For asymptotically antide Sitter backgrounds, the spectra form a characteristic pattern in the complex frequency plane, colloquially known as the “Christmas tree”. At infinite coupling, the tree has only one pair of branches. At large but finite coupling, the branches become more dense and lift up towards the real axis, consistent with the expectation of forming a branch cut in the limit of zero coupling. However, it is known that at zero coupling, the corresponding correlators generically have not one but multiple branch cuts separated by intervals proportional to the Matsubara frequency. This suggests the existence of multiple branches of the “Christmas tree” spectrum in dual gravity. In this note, we show numerically how these additional branches of the spectrum can emerge from the dual gravitational action with higher-derivative terms. This phenomenon appears to be robust, yet, reproducing the expected weak coupling behaviour of the correlators quantitatively implies the existence of certain constraints on the coefficients of the higher-derivative terms of the dual gravity theory.
24	2019	Curvature Invariants and Lower Dimensional Black Hole Horizons	Daniele Gregoris, Yen Chin Ong,and Bin Wang	Curvature Invariants and Lower Dimensional Black Hole Horizons  It is known that the event horizon of a black hole can often be identified from the zeroes of some curvature invariants. The situation in lower dimensions has not been thoroughly clarified. In this work we investigate both (2+1)- and (1+1)-dimensional black hole horizons of static, stationary and dynamical black holes, identified with the zeroes of scalar polynomial and Cartan curvature invariants, with the purpose of discriminating the different roles played by the Weyl and Riemann curvature tensors. The situations and applicability of the methods are found to be quite different from that in 4-dimensional spacetime. The suitable Cartan invariants employed for detecting the horizon can be interpreted as a local extremum of the tidal force suggesting that the horizon of a black hole is a genuine special hypersurface within the full manifold, contrary to the usual claim that there is nothing special at the horizon, which is said to be a consequence of the equivalence principle. I. INTRODUCTION: LOCATING THE EVENT HORIZON OF A BLACK HOLE Black holes have been defined differently across different disciplines like astrophysics, analogue gravity and mathematical relativity [1]. For example section 12.4 of [2] introduces black holes as regions of spacetime from which nothing – not even light – can escape from, making them some of the most studied solutions to the Einstein equations of general relativity [3]. After a few decades from their introduction as a pure mathematical concept, an interpretation as astrophysical object which – as far as we know – can be fully characterized in terms of their mass, electric charge and angular momentum has been proposed. Since techniques for estimating the values of these parameters became available (for example through the keplerian motion of orbiting stars [4]), they must be regarded as physical quantities and not only as mathematical oddities entering the theory equations. The existence of black holes in the actual Universe we live in has been indirectly established through the study of the X-rays emitted by the matter falling into them before crossing the horizon [5, 6]. Much more recently, the direct detection of gravitational waves by the LIGO collaboration has brought to the first observational identification of black hole binary systems in the Universe [7]. However the prediction of the energy spectra of the waves emitted by coalescing black holes is almost entirely based on numerical techniques [8–10] and analytical methods are still scarce according to the latest review on the experimental and theoretical methods for studying gravitational waves [11]. From the theoretical point of view it has been argued that the evolution of a black hole can be fully accounted for by four mechanical (or also known as “thermodynamical” [12]) laws which relate its mass, electric charge, angular momentum, area of the horizon, surface gravity and temperature [13]. Note that the notion of the horizon is crucial in these laws: if, eventually, we have the technology to test these laws in the actual Universe, we would need to first correctly identify the horizon of a black hole. Moreover, cornerstone theorems by Hawking and Penrose proved that physical singularities (not to be confused with coordinate singularities which can be removed by a change of the coordinate system) can occur in the theory of classical general relativity [14–17]. These results have been checked explicitly with respect to the spacelike singularity that occurs in non-rotating black hole with no electric charge, and timelike singularities for rotating and electrically charged black holes, exploiting the knowledge of such exact analytical solutions. Spacetimes admitting a physical singularity are geodesically incomplete, meaning that timelike and/or lightlike geodesics cannot be extended after reaching the singular point. Thus it is not possible to know the physical behavior of such singularities, and in the case in which they are naked (that is they can be seen by an observer located at the future null infinity), physical theories would lose predictability. Thus a mechanism that prevents observers to directly see singularities is needed in a physically solid formulation of general relativity. The presence of an event horizon which hides curvature singularities seems the most convenient proposal to address this puzzle: this is the so-called cosmic censorship conjecture [18].  Unfortunately it has been claimed that even in principle at least in the near future it will not be possible to detect black hole horizons by direct astrophysical measurements because indirect measurements can only claim the existence of a black hole by measuring its mass, which must be higher than the mass of a neutron star emitting the same X-rays waves, and its accretion disk [19]. Moreover, the theoretical interpretation of the shadow imaging of a black hole observed by the Event Horizon Telescope has been done only with computer simulations [20]. Therefore at this stage, we must first focus on the analytical study of black hole horizon, and the localization of it becomes an issue of crucial importance. On the other hand, modifications to the Hilbert-Einstein action have been proposed in the recent literature for many reasons ranging from the modeling of the late time accelerated expansion of the Universe [21], to the analysis of its first inflationary stages [22], to the modeling of the rotation curve of galaxies [23], just to mention a few examples. Lower dimensional – both (2+1)- and (1+1)-dimensional – theories for gravity have been formulated with a twofold purpose of clarifying the mathematical properties of the Einstein equations (since they are a system of coupled nonlinear partial derivative equations, their solution has been derived so far only in simplified cases requiring strong symmetry assumptions) in an analogue but formally simpler case, and for developing possible frameworks for a quantum formulation of the gravitational interaction [24–27]. Even though lower-dimensional gravity is a pure topological theory, it admits black hole solutions, the first example was found in (2+1) dimensions in the presence of a negative cosmological constant [28, 29]. It is therefore of interest to see whether the mechanical and thermodynamical laws governing the evolution of (3+1)-dimensional black holes hold also for the lower-dimensional case. Assuming that the thoughts leading to the cosmic censorship conjecture still apply, it is of crucial importance for this goal to correctly identify the black hole horizon. Besides, black holes are an important tool in analogue gravity for deepening the understanding of physical systems which seem completely unrelated to them at first sight [30]. For example their acoustic or sonic properties are the exact counterpart to their optical ones in astrophysics, that is they admit a surface interpretable as an event horizon since sound signals cannot escape from it, which can be determined by the fact that the speed of flow of the fluid inside which they are formed becomes smaller than the speed of sound within the fluid. More recently an experimental detection of a black hole horizon has been proposed as realizable in a laboratory setting exploiting a Bose-Einstein condensate [31]. Moreover they provide as well an experimental realizable laboratory for the study of the as yet undetected Hawking radiation since they are supposed to emit its acoustic counterpart and it is possible to measure their temperature, and surface gravity with current available techniques [32–34]. Their analogue electromagnetic properties have been established as well in [35]. Once again theoretical techniques for locating their event horizons are playing an important role in such analyses. The purpose of this note is to provide an algorithm answering the question whether the horizon of lower dimensional black holes can be located as the zero of an appropriate curvature invariant. The location of a black hole event horizon can be searched in a non-local way by integrating the equations for the geodesic motion [2]. Other possible techniques require approximating the horizon as a minimal Riemannian surface or as a marginally outer trapped surface [36]. Recently it has been proved that it can be located by solving the zeroes of some invariants of the Riemann tensor [37, 38], and later the same argument has been extended to the use of the Cartan curvature invariants whose utility has been explicitly demonstrated for (3+1)- and (4+1)-dimensional black holes [39] leading to the geometric horizon conjecture [40, 41], which has been tested as well in multi-black holes configurations such as the Kastor-Traschen metric [42]. This literature has also shown that those curvature invariants can be used for extracting locally the values of the mass, electric charge and angular velocity of a black hole, whose mutual relationships can then be compared with the ones predicted by the previously mentioned mechanical laws governing a black hole, and in particular the scaling relation between mass and temperature, which for our lower dimensional case is going to zero when the former is vanishing contrary to the case of ordinary (3+1)-dimensional black holes [43]. Thus, it is natural to hypothesize that this is the procedure we are looking for. The interpretation of the modifications we must apply to this procedure can be used for providing new insights into the nature of the horizon of a black hole. In fact, the basic ingredient of this method, the curvature, can be decomposed into two parts, only one of which can be determined by imposing the Einstein equations. The other is completely free in (3+1)-dimensions, but on the other hand is completely constrained to vanish in lower dimensional frameworks. Thus, a comparison between our techniques for locating the horizon can indeed provide further information on the nature of black holes in different dimensions. Our manuscript is organized as follows: in the next section we will review the basic properties of a black hole horizon, in the third section we will motivate more explicitly our interest in a lower dimensional theory, in section four we will comment on the peculiar properties of (2+1)-dimensional gravity focusing on the consequences of applying our method, while in the fifth section we will present some explicit applications to the linearly and non-linearly charged Banados-Teitelboim-Zanelli (BTZ) black hole which generally depends on five physical parameters. These examples of applications clarify the applicability of the method even for a dynamical configuration currently employed in the description of the formation of a black hole. Then we will move to the same analysis but in (1+1)-dimensional gravity in section six. Finally we will discuss a connection between the Cartan invariants we constructed for locating the horizon and the behavior of tidal forces on its proximity in section seven, and we conclude in section eight summarizing the differences between our analysis and the case of (3+1)- and (4+1)-dimensional spacetimes. II. BASIC PROPERTIES OF THE BLACK HOLE HORIZON: A VERY SHORT REVIEW In this section we will review the basic definitions dealing with black horizons for the sake of completeness. Definition. Given a spacetime manifold M, any submanifold which is a spatial section of M which is topologically a 2-sphere and a null surface, whose any normal has vanishing expansion, and the projection of the stress-energy tensor along any of its null future-directed normal is future-causal, is said to be a non-expanding horizon [36]. We notice that such requirements remain true after rescaling the null normals considered. This is the same as for the Killing horizons, which are null hypersurfaces defined by the vanishing of the norm of the time-translational Killing vector field, in which it is possible to rescale the Killing vector field without affecting it. However the previous definition does not provide any practical technique for identifying these submanifolds once the full spacetime manifold is provided, that is they do not come from the solution of any differential equation. With this problem in mind, as a first attempt it has been proved that black hole horizons are minimal surfaces, i.e. surfaces which locally minimize their area [44, 45]. In this way it was possible to determine that their mean curvature vanishes identically and that they can be obtained from the solution of the Lagrange partial derivative equation derived from an action principle [46]. It is worth noticing that now these are purely geometric methods, while instead the matter content was present in the original definition of the black hole horizon through the stress-energy tensor entering the Einstein equations. Subsequently stationary and static black hole horizons have been shown to be marginally outer trapped surfaces, which are defined as closed surfaces on which outward-pointing light rays moving inwards are converging, their expansion being negative. They remain a good approximation even for dynamical configurations [47]. It is worth noticing that instead this criterion is based on the solution of the Raychauduri equation which depends on the matter content generating the spacetime under examination through its stress-energy tensor. More recently the localization of the black hole horizon has been connected to the vanishing of certain curvature invariants of the Riemann tensor [37, 39]. Curvature invariants are scalar quantities defined as the traces of products of the curvature tensors, and in general of their derivatives. They are a useful technique for classifying known solutions of the Einstein field equations in reference to the so-called equivalence problem, in which one has to check whether two very different looking solutions (derived in different coordinate systems) are in fact one and the same [48]. One of their limitations is that they cannot distinguish the vanishing scalar invariant (VSI) spacetime from Minkowski [49]. Specifically, in this paper we are interested in locating the stationary horizon of a black hole which is a null hypersurface orthogonal to a Killing vector field that is null on it. The rigorous mathematical formulation of the methods we will invesigate has been proposed in [37, 39]. However these theorems constitute only a formal result on the existence of a curvature invariant which detects the stationary horizon without delivering the explict curvature invariant which is required, nor providing a constructive algorithm. It is therefore necessary to check by hands how they behave for the lower-dimensional black holes, which is the subject of our manuscript. It is interesting to notice again that in this algorithm geometrical and physical properties of the black hole are mixed within the Riemann tensor which can be decomposed into the Weyl tensor accounting for the former and the Ricci tensor and Ricci scalar accounting for the latter. III. WHY LOWER DIMENSIONAL GRAVITY AND BLACK HOLES? Relationships between (2+1)-dimensional gravity with other theoretical frameworks have been explored since its first appearance, the Chern-Simons theory being the most famous example. In this case the dynamics is derived from an action principle in which the Lagrangian is provided by the Chern-Simons 3-form, meaning that it belongs to the class of Schwarz-type quantum field theory because its observables are computed exploiting a metric-independent action functional [50]. Moreover it admits connections to many other branches of physics ranging from condensed matter theory to quantum gravity. In the former case it was shown that the monopoles exploited for solving the dynamics are related to quantum vortices which typically are topological defects exhibited by superfluids and superconductors. Its duality with respect to M-theory on AdS4 ×S 7 has been explored as well [51]. In the latter case a supergravity theory has been formulated in which supersymmetry and general relativity are combined in a unique model by imposing supersymmetry to fulfill the locality requirement; its availability as effective low-energy limit of string theory has been discussed [52–56]. An interesting aspect for our current analysis is that string theory admits a formulation in term of the so-called Born-Infeld Lagrangian, which can be interpreted as representing a non-linear version of the Maxwell equations of electromagnetism [57–59]. In fact it has been proved that it exhibits a twofold application in gravity: on one hand it may account for the late time accelerated expansion of the Universe through the Chaplygin gas [60], while on the other, solutions picturing charged black holes can be found exactly in this theory as well [61, 62], providing an interesting arena for checking whether the current ways of localizing a black hole horizon remain valid. Applying this way of reasoning with the goal of treating the mathematical non-linearities arising in general relativity, dilatontype gravity models have been developed by Jackiw and Teitelboim [63], and by Callan-Giddings-Harvey-Strominger (CGHS in short) [64] exploring different possibilities of coupling between the dilaton field and the one time and one space dimensions of gravity. These theories present black hole type solutions despite the fact of allowing only flat geometries. IV. ON THE USE OF CURVATURE INVARIANTS FOR DETECTING A BLACK HOLE HORIZON: THE PECULIAR CASE OF LOWER DIMENSIONAL EINSTEIN THEORY In this section we want to establish whether the argument proposed in [39] for locating the horizon applies also to lower dimensional solutions, and/or if it requires any modification due to the different number of independent components of the curvature tensor. In fact, it is well known that the Weyl tensor identically vanishes for any spacetime in (2+1)-dimensional gravity, implying that the Riemann tensor Rµνρσ can be fully written in terms of the Ricci tensor Rµν , the Ricci scalar R and the metric tensor gµν as follows [43]:  where a semicolon denotes a covariant derivative, implying that both the scalar polynomial (Karlhede’s) invariant I = Rµνρσ;ηRµνρσ;η , where repeated indices are summed, and the Cartan invariant J = Rµνρσ;η identically vanish in any (2+1)-dimensional spacetime point, and therefore they cannot be used for determining the horizon location. Note in particular that this claim does not depend on the frame used for computing J, and of course it still holds in the limit Λ → 0. Iterating this procedure and increasing the order of differentiation we cannot produce any non-zero higher-order curvature invariant. Moreover using the relationship gµνg µρ = δν ρ , where δν ρ denotes the Kronecker delta, we can also see that the scalar polynomial invariants constructed by the self-contraction of the Riemann tensor, like RµνρσRµνρσ , RµναβRαβρσRµν ρσ, etc..., are constant and thus they do not provide any information concerning the horizon location. The same conclusion holds trivially even when the invariants I and J are computed in terms of the Weyl tensor rather than of the Riemann tensor. This implies that the argument proposed in [39], contrary to the cases of (3 + 1)- and higher dimensional gravity theories, cannot be used for locating the horizon of the corresponding lower dimensional Schwarzschild, Kerr, and Schwarzschild-(anti-)de Sitter black holes because the geometry does not admit enough degrees of freedom. The question now becomes if instead it remains a useful algorithm when the black hole under examination carries an electrical charge which provides a non-trivial Ricci tensor. Exploiting the same arguments as in the previous computations, we get V. EXPLICIT CASES IN 2+1 DIMENSIONS A. A first explicit example: the case of the BTZ black hole with electric charge For making the reasoning of the previous section more transparent we apply it to the test solution (2.14) of [ which describes a (2+1)-dimensional black hole written in Eddington-Finkelstein coordinates (v, r, φ) with angular velocity ω, electric charge Q and negative cosmological constant Λ = −1/l2 , while r0 is a reference length related to the mass M of the black hole for making the argument of the logarithm dimensionless. As p pointed out in [65], the black hole horizon is given by the surface N(r) = 0, which explicitly provides the solution  where round parentheses denote symmetrization. For eliminating possible ambiguities in the construction of the coframe we employ for computing the following Cartan invariants, we begin by recalling that the metric tensor is invariant under Lorentz transformations. Therefore (16) is invariant under boosts  where C1 and C2 are arbitrary functions of the manifold coordinates. Thus we must fix the triad in such a way that the curvature is in its canonical form, i.e. with the smallest possible number of non-zero independent components, which can be done applying t Then, we construct (15) setting the appropriate components to zero or equal (or proportional to each other) following eqs (5.44)-(5.51) of [66] according to the isotropy group of the black hole in hand. This procedures is the lower dimensional equivalent to appendix B of [67]. The only functionally independent frame component of the covariant derivative of the Riemann tensor reads Setting J = 0 we get the only solution r = rh, implying that the above mentioned Cartan invariant constitutes an appropriate quantity for identifying the black hole horizon. We stress the fact once again that J is computationally less expensive to compute than I because it is a first degree quantity. Moreover we observe that eqs (13) and (24) provide confirming the general discussion presented in the previous section. Finally, we stress that under a SO(1, 1) isotropy group, the frame curvature computed using the Newman-Penrose formalism admits only one independent component [66]:  B. Second explicit example: non-linearly charged BTZ black hole The metric for a non-linearly charged BTZ black hole is obtained by implementing the Born-Infeld theory within the Einstein equations. It reads [61]:  where the mass m enters the metric directly, and the limit of a charged black hole in the Maxwell theory is obtained in the limit β → +∞, while the effects of the non-linearities become stronger for small β. Using polar coordinates we can complement the previous section in which the Eddington-Finkelstein coordinates were adopted instead. The location of the horizon is given by f(rhor) = 0, which can be written implicitly as: D. Curvature invariants and the dynamical formation of a black hole The cases we studied so far can only account for static and stationary configurations, and thus they assume the existence of the black hole without entering into the details on how it was formed. For addressing this latter problem we will apply our algorithm to [69] which provides the solution for a dynamically evolving black hole in (2+1)-dimensional gravity. In this section we will see how the framework provided by the curvature invariants allows one to follow the mechanism of formation of a black hole (i.e. when in time and where in space a singularity and a horizon appear). Using an Eddington-Finkelstein-like coordinates system (u, r, ψ) the metric reads as follows:  We note that this Cartan invariant vanishes for g rr = f(u, r) = 0 detecting the horizon. Interestingly, substituting eq. (46) into the square brackets we get zero as well. This seems to be a result following the dynamical property of this solution. On the other hand, for this metric the scalar polynomial invariant I does not seem a good tool for locating the horizon. This is most easily recognized considering a numerical counterexample. For the case l = 1, u = 5, q = 2, α = −3, and r ≃ 0.041659 we get f(u, r) = 0, but I = −4880 + 1024i, where i is the imaginary unit.1 VI. BLACK HOLES IN 1+1 DIMENSIONS Grumiller et al. [26] reviews some interesting black hole solutions in (1+1)-dimensional gravity theory known under the name of Jackiw−Teitelboim theory, which are exact solutions in the dilatonic gravity theory. If we adopt the coordinate system (u, r), the general line element we must consider is: Relevant subcases are: • A Schwarzschild-like solution written in the chiral gauge [27]:  VIII. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION When we consider a (3+1)-dimensional Schwarzschild-like metric in spherical coordinates (t, r, θ, φ)  where i denotes the imaginary unit. We note that in such a case I = 0 = J where f(r) = 0 = g rr. This implies that these two curvature invariants locate the horizon of the black hole without invoking any assumption concerning the Einstein field equations, that is they work for the Schwarzshild solution, the Schwarzshild (anti-)de Sitter metric, the Schwarzschild-NUT and Reissner-N¨ordstrom black holes, etc. Interestingly they provide information about the horizon location also for vacuum spacetimes. This is a consequence of the non-triviality of the Weyl tensor in 3+1 dimensions. On the other hand, when we move to lower dimensional (2+1)-dimensional theory the Weyl tensor vanishes identically and the Riemann tensor becomes a constant in vacuum and for spacetimes characterized only by the cosmological constant. An even more drastic phenomenon takes place in the gravitational theories characterized by only one temporal and one spatial dimensions since their geometries are all necessarily flat. Thus we cannot take for guaranteed that this argument holds automatically for detecting the location of lower-dimensional black hole horizons. The purpose of this work was to investigate qualitatively and quantitatively how the dimensionality of the theory for gravity adopted influence the values of the curvature invariants which have been used for locating the horizon of a black hole in [39]. In particular, we examined in detail the role of the matter content checking explicitly that when we are dealing with a non-vacuum solution the applicability of the general method is recovered because of the non-triviality of the Riemann curvature. Moreover in section (V D) we discussed the reasons why the Cartan curvature invariant should be regarded as a more powerful method than the polynomial one for tracing the horizon of a dynamical black hole. [2] explicitly states the necessity of knowing the entire spacetime evolution for claiming if a black hole is present or not. Therefore this is why our technique is important: it does not require all this amount of information. We do not need to evolve any initial data, making this computationally convenient when numerical relativity studies are adopted. Belonging to the same line of thinking, [82] compares and contrasts local and global aspects of black hole horizons, explaining that they are located by propagating light rays. Again, our method is intended to provide a reliable alternative. Also the state of the art of numerical techniques still relies on (expensive) non-local techniques: see for example [83–86] where in particular the last one focuses on horizon deformations in lower dimensional geometries by numerical methods in the context of the AdS/CFT correspondence. To this purpose [87] investigates how new numerical relativity techniques can locate horizons already known in the literature. Our research intends to complement it from an analytical perspective. The research looking for connections between the zeros of certain curvature invariants and the location of the horizon has begun because numerical relativity simulations can extract the mass and angular momentum of a black hole only by locating its horizon and by computing its area through the excision method. Finding the location of the black hole horizon provides information about which region must be excised [88]. It is curious to see how our research fits inside the broader context dealing with the determination of a black hole horizon shortly reviewed in the second section. The very first technique for finding the horizon was based on the completely geometrical concept of minimal surface; then the subsequent technique based on the ideas of marginally outer trapped surfaces and curvature invariants involved a mixture of physical and geometrical properties of the black holes, while now we have shown that in lower dimensional gravity the black hole horizon seems to be a purely physical object because only information about the matter content of the spacetime were used for locating it arriving at a conceptually different method for finding it than the one we started from. In light of this we have considered both the 13 Maxwell theory of electromagnetism and the non-linear Born-Infeld theory for the modeling of the matter content in (2+1)-dimensional gravity, as well as the case of a dilatonic field coupled to gravity in 1+1 dimension. Information about the curvature of a given spacetime are encoded into its Riemann tensor. A clearer description can be obtained by decomposing it into its trace, the Ricci tensor, and its trace-free part, the Weyl tensor. While the former is fully determined once information of the matter content is provided via the Einstein equations, the latter remains in part free because its value is not provided by the field equations, but only some constraints must be accounted for through the Ricci identities. Thus we can intuitively speak of the Ricci tensor as the “physical” part of the curvature, and of the Weyl tensor as its “geometrical” part. This difference can be better appreciated by the textbook example of the triplet of Minkowski, Schwarzschild and Kerr metrics, which are all vacuum solutions in general relativity, meaning that they have the same Ricci tensor, but they have different Weyl tensors, which in turn makes their full curvature different, with the Minkowski spacetime being flat and the other two not. This can be appreciated also considering cosmological solutions: one can have a dust Friedman model and a dust Bianchi I, Bianchi V, or Bianchi IX models, with same matter content (dust, i.e. same physics entering the Einstein equations) but different geometries (Weyl part of the curvature). However this decomposition of the Riemann tensor does not hold anymore in lower dimensional gravity because the Weyl tensor is completely determined by the number of dimensions of the theory and it is identically zero. Thus, in our language the curvature is a purely “physical” property of the spacetime because the Riemann tensor can be fully eliminated in terms of the stress-energy tensor as we used in eq. (5), and even all solutions in (1+1)-dimensions are flat due to stricter restrictions. Once we have established that the horizon of a black hole can be found exploiting some quantities derived from the spacetime curvature, as studied in this paper, the previous decomposition of the Riemann tensor can provide a new characterization the properties of the horizon, and in particular it turns out that in lower dimensional theories it is reduced to a purely “physical” property, in our language, of the solutions, because its curvature is fully determined by the field equations. 	
25	2018	Kerr-Sen black hole as accelerator for spinning particles	Jincheng An, Jun Peng, Yan Liu, and Xing-Hui Feng	Kerr-Sen black hole as accelerator for spinning particles It has been proved that arbitrarily high-energy collision between two particles can occur near the horizon of an extremal Kerr black hole as long as the energy E and angular momentum L of one particle satisfies a critical relation, which is called the Banados, Silk, and West mechanism. Previous researchers mainly concentrated on the geodesic motion of particles. In this paper, we will take the spinning particle that will not move along a timelike geodesic into our consideration; hence, another parameter s describing the particle’s spin angular momentum was introduced. By employing the Mathisson-Papapetrou-Dixon equation describing the movement of the spinning particle, we will explore whether a Kerr-Sen black hole that is slightly different from the Kerr black hole can be used to accelerate a spinning particle to an arbitrarily high energy. We found that when one of the two colliding particles satisfies a critical relation between the energy E and the total angular momentum J, or has a critical spinning angular momentum sc, a divergence of the center-of-mass energy Ecm will be obtained. I. INTRODUCTION Bañados, Silk, and West (BSW mechanism) first proved [1] that an extremal Kerr black hole can be used as a particle accelerator in 2009, and the center-of-mass (CM) energy Ecm of two test particles can be arbitrarily high if the collision occurs near the extremal horizon and the energy E and the angular momentum L of one particle satisfies a critical relation. Based on their pioneering discussion, the BSW mechanism has been extensively studied for multifarious black holes [2–9]. Most of the previous work on the BSW mechanism focuses on the acceleration of regular particles that are not spinning; thus such particles can be treated as point particles and move along timelike geodesics. However, a real particle is an extended body with self-interaction. Here we will take spinning particles that cannot be regarded as point particles into our consideration. It has been proved in [10–13] that the movement of a spinning particle deviates from a geodesic due to the gravitational interaction. The orbits of spinning particles have been computed based on the MathissonPapapetrou-Dixon (MPD) equation [14,15]. Recently, some modification to the MPD equation was given in [16–18]. The BSW mechanism for spinning particles in the Kerr black hole has been studied in [19], where the critical total angular momentum and critical spin is, respectively, Also, the BSW mechanism for spinning particles in the Kerr-Newman black hole has been studied in [20], where the critical angular momentum and critical spin are given, respectively, as When we set the mass of the black hole M ¼ 1, for either the Kerr or the Kerr-Newman black hole, a physically acceptable value of a must satisfy 0 < a = 1, and then we know that the critical spin for either the Kerr or the KerrNewman black hole, However, in a real world, the spin of a particle must be very small, i.e., s « 1. Thus the critical spin is not applicable for the Kerr or the Kerr-Newman black hole. Also, the spinning particle collision in the Schwarzchild black hole background was discussed in [21]. The no-hair theorem states that all black hole solutions of the Einstein-Maxwell theory can be completely characterized by only three parameters: mass, electric charge, and angular momentum. As we know, the Kerr-Newman metric is a solution for a rotating and charged black hole in the Einstein-Maxwell field equation. However, rotating and charged black hole solutions can also be found in other theories, such as string theory. Black holes in string theory can be coupled with other fields, such as the dilaton field, Yang-Mills field, and antisymmetric tensor gauge field. The Kerr-Sen black hole is a solution of the low-energy effective field theory for heterotic string theory [22] and is also characterized by mass, electric charges, and angular momentum, which are similar to those of the Kerr-Newman black hole. However, the geometry of the Kerr-Sen black hole is different from that of the Kerr-Newman black hole. Because string theory is the most promising candidate of unified theory, the expected rotating and charged black hole solution would be the Kerr-Sen solution rather than the Kerr-Newman one. In fact, the BSW mechanism in the KerrSen black bole background, i.e., the collision of point particles moving along the timelike geodesic has been studied in [5], the critical relation for ultraenergetic collision given in it, was also the same as that in [1]. To further confirm such a critical relation, we will study the collision of spinning particles that occurs in the horizon of an extremal Kerr-Sen black hole and check whether the relation can still hold for a divergent Ecm. Also, we want to explore if we can find a critical spinning angular momentum leading to an infinity of Ecm like that in the Kerr or the Kerr-Newman black hole and check whether such a critical spin can be arbitrarily small; hence the requirement s « 1 is satisfied. The structure of this paper is as follows. At first, in Sec. II, we give a brief review on the Kerr-Sen black hole. Next, in Sec. III, we assumed the particles and the black hole have aligned/antialigned spin and the equatorial plane is chosen to be the orbital plane, and then we will solve the equations of motion for the spinning particle. Then in Sec. IV, we will analyze how the center-of-mass energy Ecm of two spinning colliding particles behaves on the horizon of an extremal Kerr-Sen black hole and draw out a critical total angular momentum and a critical spinning angular momentum, either of which will lead to a divergent Ecm. What is more, we also prove that the critical spin can meet the requirement s « 1; hence it is applicable in the Kerr-Sen black hole background. Finally, in Sec. V we will further check the critical total angular momentum and the critical spin. We will testify that when the critical total angular momentum or critical spin is reached, the collision of two spinning particles can indeed happen on the horizon of the extremal Kerr-Sen black hole. In Sec. VI, we will summarize all the main results we draw out in previous sections. II. REVIEW OF THE KERR-SEN BLACK HOLE We start this paper by giving a brief introduction to the Kerr-Sen black hole solution, which is described by the fourdimensional effective action of the heterotic string theory, III. MOTION OF SPINNING PARTICLE IN KERR-SEN BLACK HOLD BACKGROUND To describe the movement of spinning particles, we will employ the Mathisson-Papapetrou-Dixon equation [10,19] where S is explained as the spinning angular momentum of the spinning particle. There also exists the relation between Sab and Pa as below For simplicity, let us take the particle’s spin to be aligned with the black hole’s spin; thus we can introduce a special spin vector sðaÞ that reads where s implies both the magnitude and the direction of the particle’s spin. The particle spin is parallel to the black hole spin for s > 0, while it is antiparallel for s < 0. Then we can get these nonvanishing components of the spin angular momentum in the tetrad frame as below IV. SPINNING PARTICLES COLLISION NEAR HORIZON OF EXTREMAL KERR-SEN BLACK HOLE Here we consider that two uncharged spinning particles with the identical rest mass m are at rest at infinity (E ¼ m) and then they approach the black hole and collide near the horizon of an extremal ðµ ¼ a; r0 ¼ aÞ Kerr-Sen black hole. For the sake of simplicity, we assume that the two particles have total angular momenta j1 and j2, spin s1 and s2, respectively. The center-of-mass energy is defined by Because of the ? factor in the denominator, it appears that Eeff diverges at the horizon r ¼ r0. But this not true because, although not totally obvious, the numerator vanishes at that point as well. We can make a simple analysis. Since X, Y, Z are all finite, near the horizon ? ¼ 0, we have The maximum of sc is 3 ffiffi 3 p 4 when a ¼ 1 2. From above, we can know that different from the Kerr or Kerr-Newman case where the critical spin is unapplicable [see (1.3)], the critical spin in the Kerr-Sen black hole background can be arbitrarily small as long as we choose an appropriate a. Hence the requirement s « 1 is achievable. So far, we have drawn out a critical relation that can result in a divergent Ecm. However, there is still something unavoidable for further discussion: with such a critical total angular momentum or critical spin, is a spinning particle really able to collide with another spinning particle on the horizon? The following section was devoted to this question. V. CAN THE COLLISION BE ABLE TO OCCUR ON THE HORIZON? To guarantee that the collision between two spinning particles can indeed occur near the horizon, we should impose such a requirement on the first approaching particle—when the first particle approaches the horizon, it will move along the direction tangent to the horizon rather than getting through the horizon and falling into the black hole. Only in this way, when the second particle approaches the horizon, is it able to collide with the first particle. Hence, we need to check with the critical relation (4.10), whether a spinning particle can move along the direction tangent to the horizon. The radial equation of motion is A. Critical total angular momentum Noticing when the black hole is extremal, in R, there is a ? ¼ ðr - r0Þ2 in the second term, so we only need to concentrate on X in the first term. For the extremal KerrSen black hole, when j take the critical angular momentum jc ¼ 2a cosh2 a, we have VI. CONCLUSION In this paper, we have investigated the collision of two uncharged spinning particles (which could be thought to be the cold dark matter particles) falling freely from rest at infinity in Kerr-Sen spacetime. The Kerr-Sen black hole is a solution of four-dimensional low energy effective supergravity of the heterotic string theory. It is characterized by three parameters, mass M, charge Q, and spin a. When the rotation a vanishes, it describes a Gibbon-Maeda black hole. When the charge Q vanishes, it describes a Kerr black hole. Naively, one may think that the Kerr-Sen black hole does not have a big difference from the Kerr-Newman black hole. But our results show that they are quite different. For the extremal Kerr-Sen black hole, it was found that the CM energy of two spinning particles can be divergent when the total angular momentum j of one of the two particles reaches its critical value jc ¼ 2, which is the same as the case of the extremal Kerr black hole. Furthermore, if the spin of one of the particles satisfied sc ¼ a2ð2 a - 1Þ3=2, the CM energy might also be divergent. Different from the Kerr or Kerr-Newman case where the critical spin is unapplicable [see (1.3)], the critical spin in the Kerr-Sen black hole background can be arbitrarily small as long as we choose an appropriate a. We also discussed the condition under which the collision between two particles can take place in fact near the horizon of the extremal KerrSen black hole. At present, we performed our calculations without considering the backreaction effect of the accelerated particle pair on the background geometry of the KerrSen black hole. Because of the energy carried by the infalling particles, a new and larger horizon is formed before the particles reach the horizon of the original black hole. This in fact implies, in particular, that the optimal collision between the two particles cannot take place exactly at the horizon of the original black hole [24]. This issue deserves further research in the future.
