FIELD STRUCTURE  The theory of gravitation represents the field by a symmetric tensor  where the g, t ar e real functions of  where b is the Kronecker tensor. Here the order of indices is important and, for example, g;,g" does not equal 8 . In the following the tensor density g'" =g's(g) & plays an important role. From a group theoretical point of view the introduction of a Hermitian tensor is somewhat arbitrary, since both individual additive components gk and g@ have tensor character. However, this flaw is somewhat ameliorated by the fact that, just as in the case of real fields, there is a natural way of associating parallel translations to the Hermitian gg„ this is the main basis for the c1aim that the introduction of a Hermitian gg, is natural.  2. INFINITESIMAL PARALLEL TRANSLATIONS, ABSOLUTE DIFFERENTIATION AND CURVATURE  In the theory of real fields we give the inparallel translation of a vector A' or   with a corresponding introduction of infinitesimal parallel translations for tensors of higher rank. The second equation of (I) is connected with the first by the demand that   ALBERT EINSTFIN From (1) we get in the well-known the tensor character of  manner  where the I" will, in general, also be complex, aiid pass to the complex conjugate of this equation then we see that we have there an equation which also dehnes a parallel translation, but this parallel translation may dier from the first.

We obtain the equivalent equations  The Eqs. (3a), (3d), and (3e) are equivalent. Curvature: The change which a vector undergoes upon parallel translation around the boundary curve of an infinitesimal element of area has vector character. This leads to the formation of a curvature tensor also in the case of our generalized field. We have here the choice whether to translation or a translation; howuse a ever, the results of the two translations are conjugate complex, so that it suffices to consider one form.

INTRODUCTION  The task of imaging and modeling the millimeter emission close to the horizon of an accreting black hole with the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) encompasses a number of challenges. Interferometric imaging requires accurate synthesis of an image based on a sparse and incomplete set of Fourier visibilities (see, e.g., Honma et al. 2014; Bouman et al. 2016; Chael et al. 2016; Akiyama et al. 2017). Understanding the morphological diversity of the structure of the emission and its dependence on the physical parameters of the black hole rests on the comparison of such observations to high-fidelity simulations of the accretion flow (see, e.g., Mościbrodzka et al. 2009, 2017; Dexter et al. 2009; Chan et al. 2015b; Kim et al. 2016; Gold et al. 2017). The accretion flow itself is dynamic, potentially causing strong variations in the emission morphology over the very time scales required to synthesize an image with a large baseline interferometer (see, e.g., Lu et al. 2016; Medeiros et al. 2017, 2018). In considering all of these issues, a common thread that emerges is a need to efficiently capture and characterize a complex series of images in diverse contexts. In this and forthcoming papers, we apply Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to General Relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD) simulations and simulated EHT observations to explore its utility as an approach to addressing these challenges. PCA is a mathematical approach to quantifying variability of an ensemble. In our case, the ensemble is a collection of images obtained from time-dependent simulation outputs of black hole accretion flows. PCA is nonparametric and does not incorporate any physical knowl1 Steward Observatory and Department of Astronomy, University of Arizona, 933 N.

Instead, PCA decomposes each image into a sum of orthogonalbasis eigenvectors (i.e., eigenimages) with eigenvalues that correspond to the brightness variance that each eigenimage captures. The eigenimages are then ranked by their eigenvalues, which allows minor variations to be discarded if desired. In other words, PCA allows for a compact and effective representation of the images in the ensemble. In practice, the implicit compression can be substantial, using perhaps only a dozen eigenvectors to represent over 1000 source images (Boroson & Lauer 2010). In this initial exploration, we show that PCA is particularly useful to help recognize and characterize the large-scale temporal variability in the morphology of the millimeter emission close to the horizon of black holes such as Sgr A∗ and M87. Numerous observations and studies in the past few decades have established the fact that black hole accretion flows are highly variable. Xray observations of galactic black hole binaries reveal a variability spectrum characterized by red noise as well as distinct high-frequency quasi-periodic components (see, e.g., van der Klis 2000; Remillard & McClintock 2006). Similarly, multi wavelength observations of nearby AGN, including the Galactic Center black hole Sgr A∗ , show variability on timescales ranging from hours to months (see, e.g., Genzel et al. 2003; Do et al. 2009; Neilsen et al. 2015). This variability is not surprising. It is understood to be the result of the turbulent accretion flows as well as a potential manifestation of the unique black-hole spacetime near its horizon (see, e.g., Rauch & Blandford 1994; Chan et al. 2015a). Because of this, it is expected that the images for Sgr A∗ and M87 at mm wavelengths will also be variable at dynamical timescales at the vicinities of the black-hole horizons (Medeiros et al. 2017, 2018). Black hole variability is an important consideration for the EHT. Because interferometry relies on the rotation  2 of the Earth to obtain images, it is critical to understand how the sources may vary over timescales comparable to those observations in order to design and implement proper image reconstruction algorithms (see, e.g., Lu et al. 2016; Johnson et al. 2017; Bouman et al. 2017 for early attempts). It is also important to study and characterize the variability predicted by different accretion flow models, in order to investigate whether the mode and amplitude of predicted variability agrees with observations (see Kim et al. 2016). Both these issues are especially true for the primary target for the EHT, Sgr A∗ , for which the characteristic time of variability can be as short as a few minutes. In this paper we show that PCA can generate a compact orthogonal set of basis eigenimages that can represent accurately the ensemble of images generated in a suite of high-fidelity GRMHD simulations and facilitate the efficient comparison of models to observations. This basis may also be used to provide a compact rendition of the ensemble in Fourier space and, in turn, a path to efficient representation of the sparse visibility observations. Furthermore, we show that PCA allows us to recognize “outliers” in the typical source morphology and identify, both in simulations and in observations, instances of episodic physical phenomena, such as magnetic reconnection and flaring events. In parallel to the efforts to characterize and understand its origins, the EHT has a nearly orthogonal interest in the question of black hole variability, i.e., identifying emission signatures that are, in fact, not variable. In particular, the black hole shadow, which offers excellent opportunities for testing the predictions of general relativity (Psaltis et al. 2015), is expected both to be invariant in time and nearly independent of any property of the system other than the mass of the black hole. It is, therefore, valuable to separate time-variable aspects of black hole images, such as turbulence and periodic variabilities in the accretion flow, from the constant signals arising from the black hole spacetime. The structure of this paper is as follows. We provide a brief development of the PCA formalism in §2 and demonstrate that a PCA basis that is derived in the image domain also provides a basis in the Fourier (i.e., visibility) domain. We apply our formalism to a simple ensemble of images in §3. In §4, we demonstrate the ability of PCA to represent a temporal sequence of high-fidelity simulated images of an accreting black hole. We demonstrate the use of PCA to compactify the space of images using dimensionality reduction and to identify times of rare or unusual activity in the simulated time series in §5. In §6, we compare the spectrum of PCA eigenvalues to that of Gaussian and red-noise processes and show how the PCA eigenvalues are related to the underlying power spectrum of structures in the images. We conclude and discuss future applications of our work in §7. 2. PRINCIPAL COMPONENT ANALYSIS  Our goal is to use PCA to determine the dominant components in a set of images of black holes. In this section, we give a brief introduction to PCA and show that it may be applied directly to interferometric observables. The majority of this derivation follows Turk & Pentland (1991) with some differences that we will explicitly out-  line below. 2.1. Introduction to Principal Component Analysis The principle of PCA is to calculate a set of orthogonal eigenimages (or eigenvectors) from an ensemble of images. We can then utilize this basis to compactly represent all of the images in the original ensemble as a linear combination of those eigenimages. We denote an ensemble of m images by In (x, y), where n = 1, ..., m and the pair of coordinates (x, y) are used to represent the location of each of the N × N pixels on the image. For simplicity, each image can also be represented as a column vector In of length N 2 . For our purposes, the ensemble of images will be comprised of a series of snapshots of a black hole accretion flow that are obtained from simulations or observations, although the derivations we provide below are much more general. As the basis of our decomposition, we choose to use the m orthogonal eigenimages uk of the covariance matrix  In this equation, we defined the N 2 × m matrix A, such that its columns are the m images of the ensemble, i.e.  (2)  Strictly speaking and contrary to the notation of Turk & Pentland (1991), C is not a covariance matrix because we have not subtracted the mean from each image. However, we will refer to C as the covariance matrix throughout the paper to avoid introducing unnecessary terminology. The covariance matrix C is an N 2 × N 2 matrix that measures how the variation in the brightness of each pixel across the ensemble of images is correlated to the variation in brightness of every other pixel. We can write explicitly each element of the matrix C as  where the indices i and j correspond to the N 2 pixels (i, j = 1, 2, ..., N 2 ) and the index n = 1, 2, ..., m corresponds to the different images in the ensemble. In principle, we can then find the eigenimages uk of the covariance matrix C by diagonalizing it such that  However, diagonalizing an N 2 × N 2 matrix is computationally expensive and, in fact, not necessary. Because there are (at most) only m independent images in the ensemble, there are only m non-trivial eigenvalues and eigenvectors for this covariance matrix, which we can compute in an efficient way.4 We start by computing the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of the m × m matrix L = AT A such that  4 See, e.g., Appendix A of Strang (1988) for a discussion of this property.  3 where vγ are the m eigenvectors of L, each of dimension m. It is then easy to show by multiplying both sides of equation (5) by A that the matrix L and the covariance matrix C share the same eigenvalues, i.e.,   This equation also demonstrates that the vectors  (7)  of size N 2 , are the eigenimages of the covariance matrix C with corresponding eigenvalues λγ . The normalization of the eigenimages is, in principle, arbitrary. Following standard PCA convention, we normalize each eigenimages such that u2k = λk and   Because the eigenvectors are orthogonal, it also follows that uk uk0 = λk δkk0 , where δkk0 is the Kronecker delta. Hereafter, we will use the notation u2k = uk uTk to denote the square of the magnitude of an eigenimage. The overall sign of each eigenimage is arbitrary and, in principle, eigenimages may contain negative fluxes. In the latter case, we further multiply the brightness of each pixel in the eigenimage by −1 in order to enforce the total flux of the eigenimage to be positive. Having obtained the eigenimages of our ensemble, we can then express any of its images as the linear combination   (13)  In principle, when we use the above basis set to reconstruct each original image in the ensemble, we need all m eigenimages. However, depending on the level of fidelity required and on the uniformity of the images in the set, the PCA decomposition makes it possible for us to reduce the dimensionality of the problem by only using the first few eigenimages to reconstruct an approximation of each of the original images. This approach becomes especially useful when only a few eigenimages are significant and the rest are small. Naturally, the number of eigenimages used to construct the model depends on the particular application and does require judgment. For example, in observational data with real noise, the eigenimage expansion can be terminated when the model begins to overfit the noise. Boroson & Lauer (2010) presented a detailed analysis of the optimal way to terminate a PCA expansion given knowledge of the typical S/N ratio of the ensemble images. In characterizing images from simulations that do not include observational noise, the judgment of when to terminate the expansion is one of how much fidelity is required to capture the critical morphology of the image. Lastly, we emphasize an obvious but important application of PCA. Given a set of eigenimages, the basis can also be used to represent and analyze images that are similar to those in the set used to define the eigenimages but that are not actually in the set itself. In the present context, this means that a basis constructed from a set of simulated images of an accreting black hole should be able to represent observations of the black hole, if the simulations are sufficiently realistic. 2.2. Principal Component Analysis in the Fourier  Domain Even though we presented the PCA formalism using a set of images, the data that we ultimately aim to work with are the complex Fourier components of the image, i.e., visibility amplitudes and phases. This is because the EHT is an interferometric array and directly measures the latter quantities. Ideally, we would like to devise a method for characterizing image variability that can be used in both image space and Fourier space and that allows us to move freely between the two. From a purely mathematical point of view, the image and Fourier domains are highly symmetric, and it is straight-forward to represent an operation in one domain with a complementary operation in the other domain. In practice, however, the two domains present strongly asymmetric viewpoints. The spatial distribution of radio emission close to the horizon of an accreting black hole is readily formulated and visualized with high-fidelity simulations in the image domain. The observations are obtained in the visibility domain, however, with relatively sparse coverage. Confronting the simulations with the observations requires a sophisticated synthesis of the visibility data into an interpretable form. One path is to use general purpose image reconstruction techniques, but these may suffer from less than optimal use of the expected morphology of the observations. Our approach, instead, will be to develop a basis directly in the visibility domain that encodes the expected behavior of the source as informed by simulations. We thus need to understand how the PCA basis of the simulations will relate to their visibilities. In this section, we show that the  4 visibilities of the principal components of the simulation images are in fact the same as the principal components of the visibilities of these images. We define the 2D discrete Fourier transform of an image as   As before, we can find the eigenvectors of C by diagonalizing L0 [see equation (6)], which demonstrates equivalently that Ãvγ are eigenvectors of C 0 with eigenvalues λγ . In order to complete our proof, we must show that the eigenvectors Ãvγ are equal to the Fourier transform of the eigenvectors Avγ . In other words, we must show that the principal components of the set of visibility maps is equal to the visibilities of the principal components of the set of images. This can be seen by evaluating each component of the eigenvector Ãvγ as  Therefore, the visibilities of the principal components are indeed equal to the principal components of the visibilities. We have thus shown that the PCA basis can be developed in one domain, such as image space, but is readily applied in the complementary Fourier (or visibility) domain. This will allow us to use PCA to compare and possibly fit EHT data to simulations directly in the visibility domain. The maximally compact basis provided by the PCA approach may be well-suited to address the sparse coverage of the visibilities. 3. AN EXAMPLE OF PRINCIPAL COMPONENT ANALYSIS  To elucidate how PCA works in practice, we present, in this section, a simple example that is easy to calculate and understand. We consider a Gaussian spot moving along a circular path and simulate 1080 snapshot images, as the spot completes an integer number (3) of orbits. Figure 1 shows a few example snapshots from this model. We calculate the principal components of this image set using the PCA formalism and show in Figure 2 the first few principal components. We also show in Figure 3 the spectrum of eigenvalues we obtain for this model. The first principal component, which has the largest flux variance (∼ 12.7%), amounts to the average image of the various snapshots (modulo a normalization constant), i.e., it represents a ring surrounding the circular path with a width comparable to the width of the Gaussian spot. This is not a general property of a PCA decomposition but is exact in the particular example discussed   Figure 1. Example snapshots from a simple model of a Gaussian spot moving on a circular path. Here the red circle indicates the approximate trajectory of the center of the Gaussian spot. The linear scale of the image is arbitrary. We present PCA analysis of realistic GRMHD simulations later in the paper, but this simple example is useful for understanding how PCA decomposition of the simulations work.   Figure 2. The first 4 components of the PCA decomposition of the Gaussian spot moving on the circular path shown in Figure 1. The eigenvalues which correspond to these four components are shown in the top left of each panel, respectively. Note that in this figure, and in all figures of principal components in the rest of the paper, each component has been normalized independently so fluxes cannot be compared between different components.  here and approximately correct in the PCA decomposition of the black-hole images we will discuss in the next section. In the example of the orbiting Gaussian spot, all terms in each row of the m × m matrix L also appear in each other row of the same matrix, but displaced at different columns. This is true because the product of any two images in the ensemble depends only on the relative positions of the Gaussian spots in the two images. In other words,Pthe sum of the elements of each row of m matrix L, i.e., n=1 Lin is constant. One of the eigenvectors of a matrix with elements that obey this property is a vector that has all elements equal to one (or actually any constant, depending on how the eigenvector is normalized), i.e., v1 = [1 1 1 1 ... 1]. The eigenvector of the covariance matrix C that corresponds to this eigenvector of the matrix L is then (see eq.[7])  which (modulo a normalization constant) is nothing but the average image of the ensemble. Most eigenimages, other than the lowest-order one, have pixels with significantly positive and negative brightness, as one would expect from an eigenvector decomposition. However, because all images are positive definite and the lowest-order eigenimage is the average of the ensemble of images, it follows that the lowestorder eigenimage is also positive definite. Moreover, because of the symmetry of the ensemble of images, components 2 and 3 of the spectrum of eigenimages (in Figure 2) differ only by a rotation. The eigenvalue connected to each eigenimage is related to its variance (see equation [8]) and, hence, these two components correspond to the same eigenvalue. This behavior persists with higher components such that components come in pairs with similar eigenvalues. This creates the step pattern present in Figure 3. Here and in all simulations of black-hole images discussed in the sections below, the typical values of the   30 PCA component  Cummulative sum of eigenvalues (%)    Figure 3. (Blue curve) The spectrum of eigenvalues for the PCA decomposition of the Gaussian spot shown in Figure 1; the eigenvalues have been normalized such that they sum up to 100%. The step-like features in this spectrum are present because the high degree of symmetry in this model causes the principal components to come in pairs with very similar eigenvalues (see the second and third panels of Fig. 2). (Magenta curve) The cumulative sum of the eigenvalues. Note that only the first ∼ 40 of the 1080 components are shown and that the first 10 components contain 88% of the structural information.  amplitudes ank are very similar between different eigenimages, i.e., the typical values and distribution of the amplitudes ank depend weakly on k. Because of this and the fact that the eigenimages are normalized according to their eigenvalues (see eq. [8]), the spectrum of eigenvalues, such as the one shown in Figure 3, matches very closely the spectrum of the relative contributions of each eigenimage to the reconstruction of any of the m images in the ensemble. As a result, we can use the spectrum of eigenvalues as a proxy for investigating the relative contribution of each eigenimage to the reconstruction of a typical image in the ensemble (see below for outlier detection). This is the reason why we normalize all eigenvalues so that they sum to unity (see eq.[9]) and we often quote them as percentages. In the example of the circulating Gaussian spot that we discuss in this section, the eigenvalues drop dramatically after the first few, indicating that only a few components would be sufficient to reconstruct the original images. Specifically, under the assumption that the parameters ank are independent of k, we conclude that the first 10 (out of 1080) components account for ≈ 88% of the structures present in the ensemble of images, while ∼ 25 components account for nearly all of it. For this particular example, it is straightforward to understand why it takes only a small fraction of the eigenimages in order to reconstruct most of the structures seen in each of the images in the ensemble by estimating the number of substantially different images that are present in the ensemble. For the parameters used in this model, the FWHM of the Gaussian spot subtends ∼ 13◦ as viewed from the center of the circular path. Therefore, the full circular trajectory can be decomposed into 28 distinct Gaussian spots that are (mostly) not overlapping. In other words, there are only 28 “resolution” elements in  the circular trajectory and, therefore, the contribution of all but the first ∼ 28 eigenimages can only be negligible. 4. PRINCIPAL COMPONENTS ANALYSIS OF SIMULATED BLACK HOLE IMAGES  We now apply PCA to a set of simulated black hole images at the 1.3 mm wavelength of observations for the EHT. We focus on three of the five best-fit models (Chan et al. 2015a; Medeiros et al. 2017, 2018) that were calibrated to reproduce the broadband spectrum of Sgr A∗ and the size of the 1.3 mm emission region inferred by early EHT observations (Doeleman et al. 2008). These three models span the range of image morphologies and structural variability that we encountered in all our simulations. Specifically, Model B has a 1.3 mm image that is dominated by the accretion disk region and resembles a crescent shape, Model C has a 1.3 mm image that is dominated by the base of the jet funnel, while Model D has a 1.3 mm image that is a combination of both the base of the funnel and the disk (here we use the nomenclature of Chan et al. 2015a to label the models). The simulations were generated by performing timedependent general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD) simulations using the 3D HARM code (Gammie et al. 2003; Narayan et al. 2012; Sa̧dowski et al. 2013) and by carrying out radiative transfer and geodesic ray tracing calculations on the simulation outputs using GRay (Chan et al. 2013). Because GRay is a massively parallel GPU based code, we were able to generate images as a function of time with high spatial and temporal resolution, for a large number of simulations, while varying the black hole spin, the geometry of the magnetic field, and the plasma model (see Chan et al. 2015b for a detailed description). We show in Figure 4 four example snapshots from Model B highlighting the structural variation in the emission region that is prominent in this model. Hereafter, when displaying images of black holes, we will measure all lengths in units of the gravitational radius GM/c2 , where M is the mass of the black hole and G and c are the gravitational constant and speed of light, respectively. The radius of the black-hole shadow is approximately equal to 5 gravitational radii while the center of the shadow is displaced with respect to the center of gravity, depending on the spin of the black hole (see, e.g., Chan et al. 2013). We perform PCA on the three simulations described above following the procedure outlined in §2. Each image set consists of 1024 images corresponding to the number of snapshots obtained from the accretion flow simulations that span ≈ 60 hours. In Figure 5, we show the first 4 eigenimages and their respective eigenvalues for the PCA decomposition of the three models. For all models, the first eigenimage (left) is similar to the time average of the ensemble of images (see Figure 1 in Medeiros et al. 2017 for a comparison with the time averaged images of these simulations). This is true because all images have a dominant structure (i.e., a crescent or the footprints of the funnel), on top of which the variability of the accretion flow introduces sub-dominant perturbations. As a result, the correlations between the various snapshots are very similar to each other and the arguments given in §3 for the dominant eigenimage apply here as well, but only approximately. Although PCA is a purely mathematical tool and is ag-   Figure 4. Four example snapshots of the ensemble of black-hole images computed using Model B at a wavelength of 1.3 mm (see text for description of the model and of the simulations). None of these snapshots correspond to an instant with a significant flare in the flux of the black hole. For this and the following figures, the peak flux in each panel has been normalized to unity so changes in overall flux have not been preserved. The original images span 32 GM/c2 on each side and the full size images are used in all calculations; however, we choose to show only the innermost ∼ 20GM/c2 in the figures throughout the paper so that the black hole shadows are easy to distinguish. The red circles in the figures correspond to the expected size and location of the black hole shadow for each particular model. The location of the circle relative to the center of the image depends on the black hole spin and is not necessarily centered on the location of the black hole itself.  nostic about the physics of the system, some of the components do appear to have identified important physical features. For example, the second component in Model B shown in the top row of Figure 5 appears to have identified a region of the Doppler boosted accretion disk (center of the crescent shape) that is very close to the black hole shadow and is highly variable in the simulations (see e.g., the second and third panels of Figure 4). The third and fourth components of Model B appear to be tracing the Doppler boosted walls of the funnel region. This also matches the behavior that can be seen directly in the simulation, where the relative brightness of the wall of the funnel region is highly variable (see, e.g., the fourth panel of Figure 4). Note that, due to the 60 degree inclination of the observer relative to the spin axis of the black hole in these simulations, the base of the funnel appears to come from within the black hole shadow but is actually positioned between the observer and the black hole. In Model C (middle row), the second component highlights the edge of the black hole shadow while the other two components show various ways in which the structure of the emission at the base of the funnel varies. The PCA decomposition for Model D (bottom row) shows some features of Model B, i.e., that a crescent shape is present, and also some features of Model C, i.e., that the base of the funnel is an important variable feature in the image. In Figure 6, we plot the spectra of eigenvalues of the PCA decomposition of the images from the three models. Unlike the example of the Gaussian spot discussed in §3, the eigenvalue of the first principal component in all three models overwhelms that of the remaining components. For example, the eigenvalue of the first component of Model D corresponds to ∼ 89%, whereas the eigenvalue of the second component drops to only ∼ 2%. In other words, under the assumptions discussed in §3, only the first two components (out of 1024) are required to account for 90% of the structures in the images from  Model D and only the first three components are required to reach the same level for Model C. This result indicates that PCA can be extremely useful in reducing the dimensionality of the images that arise in these GRMHD simulations and that only the first few components are needed to preserve the majority of the image structure. Model B differs somewhat from the other two models in this regard. The eigenvalue that corresponds to the first component is equal to ∼ 66%, i.e., it is ∼ 20% less than in the other two models. Correspondingly, as many as 33 components are required to account for 90% of the structure seen in the images for model B, showing that this model contains significantly more structural variability than the other models. This is in agreement with the findings reported in Chan et al. (2015a) and Medeiros et al. (2017, 2018), where the higher level of flux variability and flaring behavior was attributed to structural changes rather than to simple brightness fluctuations. Nevertheless, even for such a simulation that shows more significant structural variability, the required number of components (33) is significantly smaller than the total number of images, making PCA useful for dimensionality reduction. We explore this result further in the following section. It is intriguing that despite the differences in the relative importance of the first ∼ 10 eigenvalues, the eigenvalue spectrum declines with the same slope for the higher components in all models. This suggests a common origin for the slope of the eigenvalue spectrum, which we will explore in detail in §5. Finally, we also apply the PCA analysis directly on the complex visibilities of our image set, which are the components of the 2D Fourier transform of each image. As we showed in §2.2, we can either calculate the complex visibility maps for each image in our ensemble and then perform PCA or calculate directly the complex visibility maps for each PCA component of the ensemble of images; the results will be identical. Given that the images correspond to vectors with real elements whereas    Figure 5.

The principal component for each simulation (leftmost panel) is approximately equal to the average image from the simulation (see Figure 1 in Medeiros et al. 2017).  the visibilities correspond to vectors with complex elements, we follow the second procedure, which is easier to implement. In Figure 7, we show the first four PCA components of the visibility amplitudes and visibility phases of Model B. As expected, the structures of the visibility amplitudes and phases changes significantly between these four components. In fact, the visibility amplitudes  of higher components have more power at longer baselines, which is a direct consequence of the fact that they contain smaller scale structures. 5. DIMENSIONALITY REDUCTION AND OUTLIER IDENTIFICATION    Figure 6. The eigenvalue spectra of the PCA decomposition of the images from the three GRMHD simulations we consider. The filled circles along each spectrum indicate the number of PCA components that are required to account for 90% of the image structures. The rapid decay of the eigenvalue spectrum indicates that PCA can be used to reduce significantly the dimensionality of the ensemble of images that arise in these simulations.  As we discussed in the previous section, only the first few PCA components are required to account for the majority of the structure seen in the images from each GRMHD simulation. Components with smaller eigenvalues both contribute less to the brightness of each pixel in the image (see discussion at the end of §3) and account primarily for small-scale structures (see Figure 7). As alluded to in the introduction, this conclusion (often referred to as dimensionality reduction) also offers the possibility of using a small number of measurements, such as those possible with the sparse coverage of the EHT array, to reconstruct the persistent image of a black hole and, therefore, extract the information that is most relevant for detecting its shadow. To explore the idea of using the first few components to describe the persistent structure from the variable flow, we calculate and compare reconstructions of images from the simulations using the first few components of the PCA decomposition to the original images. Figure 8 shows an example snapshot from the Model B simulation compared to its reconstruction using the first 10, 40, and 100 out of the 1024 PCA components. Although the reconstructions with only a small number of components do not reproduce the finer details of the images, they do capture their overall structure. The fidelity of reconstruction naturally increases as more components are added. The number of components we may choose to keep in a particular reconstruction and, hence, the degree of dimensionality reduction will naturally depend on the goal of the reconstruction. Nevertheless, even at a qualitative level, this figure suggests that dimensionality reduction by factors of 10 to 100 may be achievable in characterizing black-hole images with PCA. The snapshot in Figure 8 is typical and, therefore, can easily be reconstructed using only the first few PCA com-  ponents. However, there may be snapshots within a given simulation that are much harder to reconstruct because the structure of the image is unusual compared to the rest of the ensemble. For the purposes of this work, we will define an outlier as an image that cannot be easily reconstructed by the first few (or a “typical” number of) eigenimages. As we will show below, PCA allows us to devise an algorithmic approach for outlier detection. When we apply PCA to numerical simulations, this outlier detection will enable us to efficiently identify instances where rare and episodic events occurred in the simulation, e.g., a flare in the emission properties of the accretion flow. When we apply PCA to observational data, detecting outliers will allow us to identify similar episodic events that may be caused by physical phenomena or data corruption. There are many ways of using PCA to identify outliers in a set of images. A common method measures the Euclidean distance of each image in the hyperspace spanned by the set of eigenimages (often related to the Mahalanobis distance, Mahalanobis 1936). In implementations of outlier detection based on the Mahalanobis distance, the ensemble of images (or other data) is often standardized such that the distribution of pixel brightness within each image has been mean centered and scaled by its standard deviation. Because we have chosen not to standardize our data set, applying the Euclidean distance method directly to our PCA implementation would identify as outliers images that are simply brighter than the average image but without necessarily any substantial structural difference. In the context of using PCA to describe simulations of accreting black holes, we can easily identify such bright events by simply looking at large excursions of the total flux from the mean value. Our goal, instead, is to identify as outliers those snapshots with structures in the images that are substantially different from those of the typical snapshots. For this reason, we define a Euclidean distance using the fractional contribution of each eigenimage to the reconstruction of an image in the ensemble (see eq. [13]). We will consider a given snapshot (In ) as typical, if it can be adequately reconstructed by the first l eigenimages (l can be chosen based on the particular distribution and application). To quantify the degree to which a  that measures the weighted squared Euclidean distance from the mean of the distribution of a0nk , scaled by the standard deviation of the distribution, and projected onto the subspace of eigenimages that is not being used in the reconstruction.

The three right panels show the same snapshot from Model B but reconstructed using only the first 10, 40, and 100 components from the PCA decomposition.

We set the weight function to wk = λk because, in our implementation, the typical contribution of each eigenimage to any reconstruction is  √ proportional to λk and we want to give more weight to the most dominant eigenimages when identifying outliers. In Figure 9 we show Rnl for l = 5, 10, and 20 for  11   Figure 9. The dotted black line shows the normalized light curve for Model B. The cyan, red, and blue curves correspond to the quantity Rnl for l = 5, 10, and 20, respectively. The peaks in the cyan, red, and blue curves indicate time instances that cannot be adequately reconstructed by only the first few components and are, hence, identified as outliers. The three time instances identified as ‘row 1’,‘row 2’, and ‘row 3’ correspond to the images that are shown in Figure 10.  all snapshots in Model B as well as the normalized lightcurve. A number of time instances can be easily identified as atypical, i.e., with Rnl 1, but these instances do not necessarily correlate with large brightness excursions. To examine this further, we show in Figure 10 three original snapshots as well as the reconstructions using the first 5, 10, and 20 principal components. The top row (denoted as “row 1” in Figure 9) shows an example of a time instance that is not identified as an outlier but corresponds to the largest flux excursion in this simulation. Clearly, this snapshot can be easily reconstructed by the first 10 eigenimages and has a low Rnl value for all three values of l. This snapshot, despite being substantially brighter than the others, does not correspond to a significant structural change in the image. The second row (“row 2”) shows a time instance that is identified as an outlier but does not correspond to a significant flux excursion. The morphology of the image is quite unusual compared to the rest of the simulation and a reconstruction with 20 eigenimages fails to capture the general structure of the image. The third row (“row 3”) shows a time instance that is both identified as an outlier and shows a significant flux excursion. The reconstruction of this snapshot with 20 eigenimages is also inadequate. These results demonstrate that, in our simulations, flux excursions and unusual image morphologies are not necessarily coincident but the two can be disentangled with the use of the quantity Rnl that we have introduced here. 6. UNDERSTANDING THE EIGENVALUE SPECTRUM OF PCA  In this section we turn our attention to understanding the behavior of the spectrum of eigenvalues of the PCA decomposition of the GRMHD simulations. Specifically, we focus on the higher-order components, which have small eigenvalues and contribute primarily to the smallscale, variable structures seen in the images. We aim to understand the origin of their eigenvalue spectra, which have the intriguing property of being power laws with very similar slopes in all simulations. This allows us to explore whether the spectra of eigenvalues are related to the underlying properties of GRMHD turbulence and,  hence, whether measuring them in observations can help us better understand turbulence in accretion flows. The power-law shapes of the eigenvalue spectra are reminiscent of noise processes. For this reason, we begin by exploring the PCA eigenvalue spectrum of Gaussian noise in an image and then continue with a red-noise process. 6.1. Gaussian Noise  We consider a Gaussian noise model where the brightness of each pixel is a random number taken from a Gaussian distribution centered at zero. We perform PCA on 1024 images with independent realizations of Gaussian noise with a standard deviation of σ = 0.5 over 512 × 512 pixels. Figure 11 shows the first few principal components and their respective eigenvalues. Any two images in the ensemble are statistically uncorrelated. However, the elements of matrix L are not zero because small, nonzero residual correlations between any two images remain because of the finite number of pixels in each image and the statistical nature of noise. The eigenvalues of all components are similar, indicating that all of the principal components are of similar importance and dimensionality reduction is not possible for this configuration. The presence of minor correlations between pairs of images leads to a distribution of eigenvalues of finite width. Because, in PCA, we count the eigenvectors in decreasing order of their eigenvalues, this distribution leads to a spectrum of eigenvalues with a non-zero slope. Figure 12 shows the spectrum of the eigenvalues of our realization of the Gaussian noise model. The eigenvalues are normalized such that they sum to unity (see eq. [9]). Given that our simulation of Gaussian noise involves m = 1024 images, there are 1024 non-trivial eigenvalues of similar magnitude with a mean of 1/1024 ' 0.098%. To estimate the standard deviation of the distribution of eigenvalues, we consider the fact that there are mN 2 individual realizations of the Gaussian noise in the ensemble of m = 1024 images with N 2 = 5122 pixels each. We, therefore, expect the standard deviation of eigenvalues to be comparable to  Figure 10. The leftmost panels show three snapshots from the ensemble of images calculated for Model B. In each row, the three consecutive panels show reconstructions using the first 5, 10, and 20 principal components. The top row corresponds to a time instance that is not identified as an outlier, but corresponds to a large flux excursion from the accretion flow (this time step is denoted by “row 1” in Figure 9). Note that this image is well-fitted with the first 20 eigenimages, and thus has a small Rnl value. The second row corresponds to a time step which is identified as an outlier with no significant flux excursion. The third row corresponds to a time instance that is both identified as an outlier and shows a large flux excursion. Both of these latter images are poorly fitted by even 20 eigenimages and have been identified as outliers by their Rnl values.  The full range of eigenvalues in our particular realization of images is from 0.0859% to 0.1101%, which corresponds to a width of ≈ 4σ. In Figure 12, we show the range of 4σ around the expected mean magnitude of the eigenvalues to visualize this result. In contrast to Gaussian noise, the spectra of PCA eigenvalues for our GRMHD simulations, including the power-law tails at large eigenvector numbers, do not depend on either the number of images or the number of pixels. We tested this by decreasing our spatial and temporal resolution by factors of 2 and 4 but preserving the total time span and image size. This behavior indicates that the structures present in our simulations are much larger than the pixel size; as a result, changing the number of pixels does not alter the PCA decomposition. A similar argument is valid for the lack of dependence on the number of images. For this reason, we now turn our attention to noise spectra with maximum power at scales that are larger than the pixel sizes.  6.2. Red Noise  The spatial and time variability of images of accretion flows, such as those from Sgr A∗ , are expected to be approximated by red-noise power spectra. This is based both on the observationally measured flux variability of Sgr A∗ (Meyer et al. 2008, Dexter et al. 2014) as well as on theoretical models (e.g., Dolence et al. 2012 and Chan et al. 2015a). Other physical phenomena that affect black-hole images, such as refractive scattering in the intervening medium, are also expected to introduce noise at different characteristic scales (e.g., Johnson & Narayan 2016). Because of such considerations, we consider here an ensemble of images with structure described by an isotropic, red-noise 2D Fourier spectrum given by	ABSTRACT We explore the use of principal component analysis (PCA) to characterize high-fidelity simulations and interferometric observations of the millimeter emission that originates near the horizons of accreting black holes. We show mathematically that the Fourier transforms of eigenimages derived from PCA applied to an ensemble of images in the spatial-domain are identical to the eigenvectors of PCA applied to the ensemble of the Fourier transforms of the images, which suggests that this approach may be applied to modeling the sparse interferometric Fourier-visibilities produced by an array such as the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT). We also show that the simulations in the spatial domain themselves can be compactly represented with a PCA-derived basis of eigenimages allowing for detailed comparisons between variable observations and time-dependent models, as well as for detection of outliers or rare events within a time series of images. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the spectrum of PCA eigenvalues is a diagnostic of the power spectrum of the structure and, hence, of the underlying physical processes in the simulated and observed images. Keywords: accretion, accretion disks — black hole physics — Galaxy: center — techniques: image processing

This is shown in Figure 15, where the filled circle on each spectrum corresponds to the eigenvalue of the n−th PCA component given by the above relation. Clearly, as qmin increases, the structures on the images become smaller and more PCA components are necessary to reconstruct with fidelity the original ensemble of images. For a given value of the parameter qmin , the number of images m in the ensemble determines whether the spec-   Figure 17.

Indeed, as we discussed above, for small values of qmin , which correspond to large dominant noise structures, a small number of eigenimages is required to reconstruct with fidelity  , the eigenvalue spectrum has converged and its shape depends only very weakly on the number m of images in the ensemble. Figure 16 shows the spectrum of PCA eigenvalues for images with Fourier spectra characterized by different power-law indices α > −1. As in Figure 15, the spectra are relatively flat until the n−th PCA component but then turn into power laws with indices that appear to be correlated with α. For α . −1, which we do not show, the dominant noise structures occur at the small scales ' 1/qmax and the resulting eigenvalue spectra are flat with very weak dependence on α. We further explore the dependence of the eigenvalue spectra on α > −1 by fitting the higher components of each eigenvalue spectrum with a power-law function of the form λk ∼ k −γ and show in Figure 17 the dependence of the fitted power-law index γ on α. We find this dependence to be   Note that, for the simulations used in generating Figure 17, we set qmin = 0.1 to force the breaks of the eigenvalue spectra to occur at low PCA components and, thus, to allow for a more accurate determination of the powerlaw index of the spectra. This result demonstrates that the 2D Fourier spectrum of the structures in the image plane determine in a predictable way the high-end spectrum of PCA eigenvalues and, therefore, the latter can be used to infer the former.  from GRMHD Simulations We compare in Figure 16 the spectra of PCA eigenvalues from the black-hole images of GRMHD simulations to those of the images with red-noise Fourier spectra. The large range of eigenvalues in the GRMHD simulations is clearly inconsistent with the small expected range of eigenvalues for purely Gaussian noise (see also Fig. 12). This suggests a more complex origin of image structure and variability than what has been assumed in the past (cf. Broderick et al. 2016). The spectra of PCA eigenvalues for the images of GRMHD simulations become power laws after only the first handful of PCA components. This suggests that Lqmin for these simulations is a small number (see eq. [34] and Figure 15) and, therefore, that the typical scale of variable structure in the images is comparable to the size of the images themselves. In other words, it is comparable to the size of the black-hole shadow. This is consistent with the discussion in Medeiros et al. (2017, 2018), who attributed the variability of the simulated interferometric amplitudes and closure phases to overall changes in the widths of the crescent-like images as well as to the appearance and disappearance from the images of large, hot, and, therefore, bright magnetic flux tubes that orbit the black hole. The power-law indices in the eigenvalue spectra of the images from GRMHD simulations are nearly independent of the underlying model and equal to γ ' 1.3. Using equation (35), we find that this implies a power-law index for the 2D Fourier spectrum of the variable structures of α ' −0.5. It is important to emphasize here that this power-law index characterizes the 2D Fourier spectrum of the variable structures, which are determined in a complex, non-linear way by the anisotropies in the density, temperature, emissivity, magnetic field, and lensing in the vicinity of the black hole. It is, therefore, not surprising that the inferred value of α does not reflect the underlying power-spectrum of the MHD turbulence in the accretion flow. 7. CONCLUSION  Understanding the horizon-scale millimeter emission around an accreting black hole requires a two-pronged approach. One component is to utilize our best understanding of the physics to generate high-fidelity GRMHD simulations of the morphology of the emission. The second is to use an interferometer, such as the EHT, to test the understanding of the physics with real observations. In both components, there is a common theme: the question of how we characterize and extract the salient information in an ensemble of images. In this paper, we have demonstrated that PCA offers an effective tool for this task over a wealth of different problems. Focusing purely on the simulations, we showed that PCA offers an extremely compact representation of the theoretical millimeter images. Each simulation comprises over 1000 distinct images, yet we find that we can represent most of the images with only a few to a few dozen eigenimages, depending on the desired fidelity. Moreover, recognizing images poorly represented by the leading eigenimages is critical and represents another useful application of PCA. As detailed in the Introduction, tem-  16 poral variability of the strength and morphology of the millimeter emission close to the horizon is a phenomenon that can limit or compromise the construction of interferometric images. Knowledge of the amplitudes of the eigenimages needed to represent any given image can be used to define a simple scalar metric that flags outliers in either the simulations or observations. This approach has already provided the realization that outliers may be more subtle than had been presumed. It had been supposed that flares in flux would correspond to events in which the emission morphology would show strong departures from the average form. Yet the outlier metric Rnl (see Eq. 28) allowed us to identify both images that had unusual morphology with no significant excursion in flux, as well as flare events that had perfectly ordinary morphology. As useful as this particular metric is in this work, however, we emphasize that other metrics and classifiers can be constructed from the locations of the simulated images in their eigenspace. Our goal here is not to strongly advocate any particular metric but to provide a useful example of what is possible within the PCA representation. Apart from the identification of outliers, we also demonstrated the use of the eigenvalue spectrum to characterize the properties of the noise and turbulent structure in the simulations. This approach shows a path for allowing the rapid quantitative evaluation of GRMHD simulations over a significant timespan of accretion. As with the outlier metric Rnl , other diagnostic metrics can be built around the locations or trajectories of the simulated images as a function of time in their eigenspace. Lastly, we showed that PCA may be applied directly to the analysis of interferometric data because the Fourier transform of the principal components of a set of images is equivalent to the principal components of the set of Fourier transformed images. Coupled with the dimensionality reduction that we discussed above, this property opens the possibility of using PCA for efficient image reconstruction from sparse interferometric data. In parallel, the PCA approach can be incorporated into the Bayesian inference method discussed in Kim et al. (2016), in order to generate efficient comparisons of EHT data to large suites of GRMHD simulations. We will explore these avenues in future work. 		
4	Paper3	1935	The Particle Problem in the General Theory of Relativity	JULY  1935  PHYSICAL REVIEW  VOLUME 48  The Particle Problem in the General Theory of Relativity A. EINsTEIN  AND  N. RosEN, Institute for Advanced Study, Princeton (Received May 8, 1935)  The writers investigate the possibility of an atomistic theory of matter and electricity which, while excluding singularities of the field, makes use of no other variables than the g&„of the general relativity theory and the p„of the Maxwell theory. By the consideration of a simple example they are led to modify slightly the gravitational equations which then admit regular solutions for the static spherically symmetric case. These solutions involve the mathematical representation of physical space by a space of two identical sheets, a particle being represented by a "bridge" connecting these sheets. One is able to understand why no neutral particles of negative mass are to be  found. The combined system of gravitational and electromagnetic equations are treated similarly and lead to a similar interpretation. The most natural elementary charged particle is found to be one of zero mass. The manyparticle system is expected to be represented by a regular solution of the field equations corresponding to a space of two identical sheets joined by many bridges. In this case, because of the absence of singularities, the field equations determine both the field and the motion of the particles. The many-particle problem, v;hich would decide the value of the theory, has not yet been treated.  N spite of its great success in various fields, the physics is still far from being able to provide a unified foundation on which the theoretical treatment of all phenomena could be based. We have a general relativistic theory of macroscopic phenomena, which however has hitherto been unable to account for the atomic structure of matter and for quantum effects, and we have a quantum theory, which is able to account satisfactorily for a large number of atomic and quantum phenomena but which by its very nature is unsuited to the principle of relativity. Under these circumstances it does not seem superfluous to raise the question as to what extent the method of general relativity provides the possibility of accounting for atomic phenomena. It is to such a possibility that we wish to call attention in the present paper in spite of the fact that we are not yet able to decide whether this theory can account for quantum phenomena. The publication of this theoretical method is nevertheless justified, in our opinion, because it provides a clear procedure, characterized by a the carrying out of minimum of assumptions, which has no other diAiculties to overcome than those of a mathematical nature. The question with which we are concerned can be put as follows: Is an atomistic theory of matter and electri'city conceivable which, while excluding singularities in the field, makes use of no other field variables than those of the gravitational field (g„„) and those of the electromagnetic field in the sense of Max&veil (vector poten-  One would be inclined to answer this question in the negative in view of the fact that the  -- present theoretical  Schwarzschild solution for the spherically symmetric static gravitational field and Reissner s extension of this solution to the case when 'an electrostatic field is also present each have a singularity. Furthermore the last of the Maxwell equations, which expresses the vanishing of the divergence of the (contravariant) electrical field density, appears to exclude in general the existence of charge densities, hence also of electrical  particles. For these reasons writers have occasionally noted the possibility that material particles might be considered as singularities of the field. This point of view, however, we cannot accept at all. For a singularity brings so much arbitrariness into the theory that it actually nullifies its laws. A pretty confirmation of this was imparted in a letter to one of the authors by L. Silbersfein. As is well known, Levi-Civita and Weyl have given a general method for finding axially symmetric static solutions of the gravitational equations. By this method one can readily obtain a solution which, except for two point singularities lying on the axis of symmetry, is everywhere regular and. is Euclidean at infinity. Hence if one admitted singularities as representing particles one would have here a case of two particles not accelerated by their gravitational interaction, which would certainly be excluded physically. Every field theory, in our opinion, must therefore adhere to the fundamental principle that singularities of the field are to be excluded. In the following we shall show that it is possible to do this in a natural way, that the question we   that in g'RI, there is no longer any denominator. If then we replace (3) by  are raising can be answered in the afhrmative.   SPECIAL KIND OF SINGULARITY AND ITS REMOVAL  The first step to the general theory of relativity was to be found in the so-called "Principle of Equivalence": If in a space free from gravitation a reference system is uniformly accelerated, the reference system can be treated as being "at rest, provided one interprets the condition of the space with respect to it as a homogeneous gravitational field. As is well known the latter is exactly described by the metric field' The ofthis field satisfy in general the equations   and hence the equations The g„„corresponding to (1) are regular for all one finite points of space-time. Nevertheless cannot assert tha. t Eqs. (3) are satisfied by (1) ~, x4. This is due to for at) finite values of xI, the fact that the determinant g of the g„„vanishes for xy = 0. The contravariant g&' therefore become infinite and the tensors R'I„-~ and RI,-~ take on the form 0/0. From the standpoint of Eqs. (3) the hyperplane x&=0 then represents a singularity of the field. We now ask whether the field law of gravitation (and later on the field law of gravitation and electricity) could not be modified in a natural way without essential change so that the solution (1) would satisfy the field equations for all finite points, i.e. , also for x&=0. W. Mayer has called our attention to the fact that one can make R'I„~ and RI„. into rational functions of the g„,, and their first two derivatives by multiplying them by suitable powers of g. It is easy to show ' It is worth pointing out that this metric field does not  represent the whole Minkowski space but only part of it. Thus, the transformation that converts  this system of equations is satisfied by (1) at all finite points. This amounts to introducing in place of the g&" the cofactors Lg~„] of the g~„ in g in order to avoid the occurrence of denominators. One is therefore operating with tensor densities of a suitable weight instead of with tensors. In this way one succeeds in avoiding singularities of that special kind which is characterized by the vanishing of g. The solution (1) naturally has no deeper physical significance insofar as it extends into spatial infinity. It allows one to see however to what extent the regularization of the hypersurfaces g=0 leads to a theoretical representation of matter, regarded from the standpoint of the original theory. Thus, in the framework of the original theory one has the gravitational equations where T;I, is the tensor of mass or energy density.  To interpret (1) in the framework of this theory we must approximate the line element by a slightly different one which avoids the singularity g=0. Accordingly we introduce a small constant 0- and let  the smaller o ()0) is chosen, gravitational field come to calculates from this the tensor T;k one obtains as ponents   the nearer does this  that of (1). If one (fictitious) nonvanishing  energy com- We see then that the smaller one takes o. the more is the tensor concentrated in the neighborhood of the hypersurface x& —0. From the standpoint of the original theory the solution (1) contains a singularity which corresponds to an energy or mass concentrated in the surface x& —0; from the standpoint of the modified theory, however, (1) is a solution of (3a), free from singularities, which describes the "field-producing mass, without requiring for this the introduction of any new field quantities,   It follows that only those points for which spond to points for which (1) is the metric.   is clear that all equations of the absolute differential calculus can be written in a form free from denominators, whereby the tensors are replaced by tensor densities of suitable weight. It is to be noted that in the case of the solution. (I) the whole field consists of two equal halves, separated by the surface of symmetry xl —0, such that for the corresponding points the g;i, are equal. As a xi) and ( — result we And that, although we are permitting the determinant g to take on the value 0 (for xi ——0), no change of sign of g and in general no change in the "inertial index" of the quadratic form (1) occurs. These features are of fundamental importance from the point of view of the physical interpretation, and will be encountered again in the solutions to be considered later.  THE ScHwARzscHILD SQLUTIQN  As is well known, Schwarzschild found the spherically syInmetric static solution of the gravitatlonR1 cqUatlons  (r &2m, 0 from 0 to ir, @ from 0 to 2ir); the variables xl, x2, xs, x4 are here r, 0, p, t. The vanishing of the determinant of the g„„ for 0=0 is unimportant, since the corresponding (spatial) direction is not preferred. On the other hand gli for r = 2m becomes infinite and hence we have there  If one intmduces in place of r a new variable accoldlng to thc cqURtlon R slngulRI  one obtains for ds~ the expression Thcsc ncw gfI„ale lcgulR1 functions foI Rll values of the variables, For = 0, however, g44 vanishes, hence also the determinant g. This does not prevent the field equations (3a), which have no denominators, from being satisfied for all values of the independent variables. Ke are therefore dealing with a solution of the (new) field equations, which is free from singularities for all finite points. The hypersurface u = 0 (or in the original variables, r = 2m) plays here the same role as the hypersurface xl —0 in the previous example. ~ varies from As u varies from —~ to to 2m and then again from 2m to If one tries to interpret the regular solution (Sa) in the space of r, 0, @, t, one arrives at the following conclusion. The four-dimensional space is described mathematically by two congruent parts or "sheets, " corresponding to N&0 and u &0, which are joined by a hyperplane r = 2m or u=0 in which g vanishes. ' We call such a connection between the two sheets a "bridge. Ke see now in the given solution, free from singularities, the mathematical representation of an elementary particle (neutron or neutrino). Characteristic of the theory we are presenting is the description of space by means of two sheets. A bridge, spatially finite, which connects these sheets characterizes the presence of an electrically neutral elementary particle. With this conception one not only obtains the representation of an elementary particle by using only the field cquatlons, thRt ls, wlthoUt lntloduclng ncw field quantities to describe the density of matter; one is also able to understand the atomistic character of matter as well as the fact that there can be no particles of negative mass. The latter is made clear by the followimg considerations. If we had started from a Schwarzschild solution with negative rn, we should not have been able to make the solution regular by introducing a new variable u instead of r; that is to say, no "bridge" is possible that corresponds to a particle of negative mass. If we consider once more the solution (I) from the standpoint of the information we have acquired from the Schwarzschild solution, we see that there also the two congruent halves of the space for xl&0 and xi&0 can be interpreted as two sheets each corresponding to the same physical space. In this sense the example represents a gravitational 6CM, independent of x~ and x~, which ends in a plane covered with mass and forming a boundary of the space. In this example, as weH as in the Schwarzschild case, a solution free fmm singularities at all finite points is made possible by the intmduction of the modifie  Because  of the symmetry about the hypersurface of g (loes not change at this hypersurface. The main value of the considerations we are presenting consists in that they point the way to a satisfactory treatment of gravitational mechanics. One of the imperfections of the original relativistic theory of gravitation was that as a field theory it was not complete; it introduced the independent postulate that the law of motion of a  particle is given by the equation of the geodesic. ' A complete field theory knows only fields and not the concepts of particle and motion. For these must not exist independently of the field but are to be treated as part of it. On the basis of the description of a particle without singularity one has the possibility of a logically more satisfactory treatment of the combined problem: The problem of the field and that of motion coincide. If several particles are present, this case corresponds to finding a solution without singularities of the modified Eqs. (3a), the solution representing a space with two congruent sheets connected by several discrete "bridges. Every such solution is at the same time a solution of the field problem and of the motion problem. In this case it will not be possible to describe the whole field by means of a single coordinate system without introducing singularities. The simplest procedure appears to be to choose coordinate systems in the following way: (1) One coordinate system to describe one of the congruent sheets. With respect to this system the field will appear to be singular at every bridge. (2) One coordinate system for every bridge, to provide a description of the field at the bridge and in the neighborhood of the latter, which is free from singularities. Between the coordinates of the sheet system and those of each bridge system there must exist outside of the hypersurfaces g=0, a regular coordinate transformation with nonvanishing determinant.   CQMEINED  FIEI.D. ELEcTRIcITY  The simplest method of fitting electricity into the conceptual framework of the general theory of relativity is based on the following train of  ' To be sure, this weakness was formally avoided in the original theory of relativity by the introduction of the energy tensor into the field equations. It was clear, however, from the very beginning that this was'only a provisory completion of the theory in the sense of a phenon&enological in t:erpreta tion. thoughts. If besides the pure gravitational field other field variables are also present, the field equations of gravitation are . In the case of the phenomenological representation of matter if it is to be considered as "dust-like, " that is, without pressure one takes where where p is the density-scalar, dx'/ds the velocityvector of the matter. It is to be noted that T44 is accordingly a positive quantity. In general the additional field-variables satisfy such differential equations that, in consequence of them, the divergence T, k. vanishes. As the divergence of the left side of (4) vanishes identically, this means that among all the field equations those four identities exist which are needed for. their compatibility. Through this condition, in certain cases, the structure of Tik, not however its sign, is determined. It appears natural to choose this sign in such a way that the component 7'4' (in the limit of the special relativity theory) is always positive. The Maxwell electromagnetic field, as is well known, is represented by the antisymmetric field tensor which satisfies the field equations These equations have the well-known quence that the divergence of the tensor vanishes. The sign has been so chosen that T4 is positive for the case of the special relativity theory. If one puts this Tik into the gravitational Eqs. (4), then the latter together with (6) and (7) form a theory .of gravitation and electricity. It so happens that we are forced to put the negative of the above into the gravitational equations if it is to be possible to obtain static spherically symmetric solutions of the equations, free from singularities, which could represent electrical particles. Making this change of sign one  Here m has obviously the significance of a gravitating mass, e that of an electrical charge. It turns out that also in this case there is no difficulty in forming a solution without singularity corresponding to the solution just given. 4 Curiously enough, one finds that the mass m is not determined by the electrical charge e, but that e and m are independent constants of integration. It also turns out that for the removal of . the singularity it is not necessary to take the ponderable mass m positive. In fact, as we. shall show immediately, there exists a solution free from singularities for which the mass constant m vanishes. Because we believe that these massless solutions are the physically important ones we will consider here the case m =0. The field equations without denominators can be written where in the last equation the term in R has been omitted because it vanishes in consequence of (7), by which T is zero. If in Eq. (8) (with m=0) one replaces r by the variable u according to the equation  This solution is free from singularities for all finite points in the space of two sheets and the charge is again represented by a bridge between the sheets. It is the representation of an elementary electrical particle without mass. we had taken the usual sign for T,~„-, the solution would involve+a' instead of — e'. It would then not. be possible, by making a coordinate transformation, to obtain a solution free from singularities.  RELATIVI T Y SUMMARY AND GENERAL  REMARKS  If one solves the equations of the general theory of relativity for the static spherically symmetric case, with or without an electrostatic field, one finds that singularities occur in the solutions. If one modifies the equations in an unessential manner so as to make them free from denominators, regular solutigns can be obtained, provided one treats the physical space as consisting of two congruent sheets. The neutral, as well as the electrical, particle is a portion of space connecting the two sheets (bridge). In the hypersurfaces of contact of the two sheets the determinant of the g„„vanishes. One might expect that processes in which several elementary particles take part correspond to regular solutions of the field equations with several bridges between the two equivalen t, sheets corresponding to the physical space. Only by investigations of these solutions will one be able to determine the extent to which the theory accounts for the facts. For the present one cannot even know whether regular solutions with morc than one bridge exist at all. It appears that the most natural electrical particle in the theory is one without gravitating mass. One is therefore led, according to this theory, to consider the electron or proton as a two-bridge problem. In favor of the theory one can say that it explains the atomistic character of matter as well as the circumstance that there exist no negative neutral masses, that it introduces no new variables other than the g„„and y„, and that in principle it can claim to be complete (or closed). On the other hand one does not see a priori whether the theory contains the quantum phenomena. Nevertheless one should not exclude a priori the possibility that the theory may contain them. Thus it might turn out that only such regular many-bridge solutions can exist for which the "charges" of the electrical bridges are numerically equal to one another and only two different "masses" occur for the mass bridges, and for which the stationary "motions" are subject to restrictions like those which we encounter in the quantum theory. In any case here is a possibility for a general relativistic theory of matter which is logically completely satisfying and which contains no new hypothetical elements.		
5	Paper4	1939	On Continued Gravitational Contraction	PHYSICAL REVIEW  VOLUME 56  Contraction SNYDER  of California, Berkeley, California (Received July 10, 1939) On Continued Gravitational Contraction  When all thermonuclear sources of energy are exhausted a suSciently heavy star will collapse. Unless fission due to rotation, the radiation of mass, or the blowing off of mass by radiation, reduce the star's mass to the order of that of the sun, this contraction will continue indefinitely. In the present paper we study the solutions of the gravitational field equations which describe this process. In I, general and qualitative arguments are given on the behavior of the metrical tensor as the contraction progresses: the radius of the star approaches asymptotically its gravitational radius; light from the surface of the star is progressively reddened, and can escape over a progressively narrower range of angles. In II, an analytic solution of the field equations confirming these general arguments is obtained for the case that the pressure within the star can be neglected. The total time of collapse for an observer comoving with the stellar matter is finite, and for this idealized case and typical stellar masses, of the order of a day; an external observer sees the star asymptotically shrinking to its gravitational radius.  RECENTLY it has been shown' that the general relativistic field equations do not possess any static solutions for a spherical distribution of cold neutrons if the total mass of the neutrons is greater than 0.7Q. It seems of interest to investigate the behavior of nonstatic solutions of the field equations. In this work we will be concerned with stars which have large masses, &0.7Q, and which have used up their nuclear sources of energy. A star under these circumstances would collapse under the inAuence of its gravitational field and release energy. This energy could be divided into four parts: (1) kinetic energy of motion of the i J. R. Oppenheimer  particles in the star, (2) radiation, (3) potential and kinetic energy of the outer layers of the star which could be blown away by the radiation, (4) rotational energy which could divide the star into two or more parts. If the mass of the original star were sufficiently small, or if enough of the star could be blown from the surface by radiation, or lost directly in radiation, or if the angular momentum of the star were great enough to split it into small fragments, then the remaining matter could form a stable static distribution, a white dwarf star. We consider the case where this cannot happen. If then, for the late stages of contraction, we effect of any can neglect the gravitational escaping radiation or matter, and may still neglect the deviations from spherical symmetry  R. OPPENHEI MER AND H. SNYDER  produced by rotation, the line element outside the boundary r& of the stellar matter must take the form  Here ro is the gravitational radius, connected with the gravitational mass nz of the star by rp=2mg/c', and constant. We should now expect that since the pressure of the stellar matter is insufficient to support it against its own gravitational attraction, the star will contract, and its boundary r& will necessarily approach the gravitational radius ro. Near the surface of the star, where the pressure must in any case be low, we should expect to have a local observer see matter falling inward with a velocity very close to that of light; to a distant observer this motion will be slowed up by a factor (1 ro/r&). All e— nergy emitted outward from the surface of the star will be reduced very much in escaping, by the Doppler effect from the receding source, by the large gravitational red-shift, (1 —ro/rz)l, and by the gravitational deflection of light which will prevent the escape of radiation except through a cone about the outward normal of progressively shrinking aperture as the star contracts. The star thus tends to close itself off from any communication with a distant observer; only its gravitational field persists. We shall see later that although it takes, from the point of view of a distant observer, an infinite time for this asymptotic isolation to be established, for an observer comoving with the stellar matter this time is finite and may be quite short. Inside the star we shall still suppose that the matter is spherically distributed. We may then take the line element in the form (1). For this line element the field equations are  primes represent differentiation with respect to r and dots differentiation with respect  in which  to t. The energy-momentum tensor T„I" is composed of two parts: (1) a material part due to electrons, protons, neutrons and other nuclei, (2) radiation. The material part may be thought of as that of a fluid which is moving in a radial direction, and which in comoving coordinates would have a definite relation between the pressure, density, and temperature. The radiation may be considered to be in equilibrium with the matter at this temperature, except for a flow of radiation due to a temperature gradient. We have been unable to integrate these equations except when we place the pressure equal to zero. However, one can obtain some information about the solutions from inequalities implied by the differential equations and from conditions for regularity of the solutions. From Eqs. (2) and (3) one can see that unless X vanishes at least as rapidly as r' when r~o, T44 will become singular and that either or both TI' and v' will become singular. Physically such a singularity would mean that the expression used for the tensor does not take account energy-momentum of some essential physical fact which would really smooth the singularity out. Further, a star would not in its early stage of development possess a singular density or pressure; it is impossible for a singularity to develop in a finite time. If, therefore, X(r=0) =0, we can express X in terms of T44, for, integrating Eq. (3)    Therefore ) &~ 0 for all r since T4' &~ 0. Now that we know ) &~ 0, it is easy to obtain some information about v' from Eq. (2);  since ) and   are equal to or greater than  zero.  If we use clock time at r = ~, we may take  GRAVITATIONAL  Since T4' is greater than zero and T&' is less than zero we conclude   Because of the boundary  conditions on  CONTRACTION For the solution of this problem, we have found it convenient to follow the earlier work of Tolman' and use another system of coordinates, which are comoving with the matter. After finding a solution, we will introduce a coordinate transformation to put the line element in form (1). We take a line element of the form:  For those parts of the star which are collapsing, i.e. , all parts of the star except those being blown away by the radiation, Eq. (5) tells us that X is greater than zero. Since ) increases with time, it may (a) approach an asymptotic value uniformly as a function of r; or (b) increase indefinitely, although certainly not uniformly as a function of r, since X(r=0) =0. If X were to approach a limiting value the star would be approaching a stationary state. However, we are supposing that the relationships between the T„& do not admit any stationary solutions, and therefore exclude this possibility. Under case (b) we might expect that for any value of r greater than zero, 'A will become greater than any preassigned value if t is sufficiently large. If this were so the volume of of the energy  and all other components mentum tensor vanish. The field equations are:  To investigate this question  we will solve the with the limiting form of the tensor in which the pressure energy-momentum is zero. When the pressure vanishes there are no static solutions to the field equations except when all components of T „I" vanish. With P = 0 we have the free gravitational collapse of the matter. We believe that the general features of the solution obtained this way give a valid indication even for the case that the pressure is not zero, provided that the mass is great enough to cause collapse. field equations  would increase indefinitely with time; since the mass is constant, the mean density in the star would tend to zero. We shall see, however, that for all values of r except ro, X approaches a finite limiting value; only for r=ro does it increase indefinitely.

6	Paper5_1	1973	Black Holes and Entropy*	PHYSICAL REVIEW   1973  Black Holes and Entropy* Jacob D. Bekensteing  Joseph Henry Laboratories, Princeton University, Princeton, Neu Jersey OS540 and Center for Relativity Theory, The University of Texas at Austin, Austin, Texas 78712|: P, eceived 2 November 1972)  There are a number of similarities between black-hole physics and thermodynamics. Most striking is the similarity in the behaviors of black-hole area and of entropy: Both quantities tend to increase irreversibly. In this paper we make this similarity the basis of a thermodynamic approach to black-hole physics. After a brief review of the elements of the theory of information, we discuss black-hole physics from the point of view of information theory. We show that it is natural to introduce the concept of black-hole entropy as the measure of information about a black-hole interior which is inaccessible to an exterior observer. Considerations of simplicity and consistency, and dimensional arguments indicate that the black-hole entropy is equal to the ratio of the black-hole area to the square of the Planck length times a dimensionless constant of order unity. A different approach making use of the specific properties of Kerr black holes and of concepts from information theory leads to the same conclusion, and suggests a definite value for the constant. The physical content of the concept of black-hole entropy derives from the following generalized version of the second law: When common entropy goes down a black hole, the common entropy in the black-hole exterior plus the black-hole entropy never decreases. The validity of this version of the second law is supported by an argument from information theory as well as by several examples.  I. INTRODUCTION A black hole' exhibits a remarkable tendency to increase its horizon surface area when under-  This was first noticed going any transformation. by Floyd and Penrose' in an example of the extraction of energy from a Kerr black hole by means of what has come to be known as a Penrose process. They suggested that an increase in area might be  '  a general feature of black-hole transformations. Christodoulou" had shown that no Independently, process whose ultimate outcome is the capture of a particle by a Kerr black hole can result in the decrease of a certain quantity which he named the irreducible mass of the black hole, M. . In fact, most processes result in an increase in M„. with the exception of a very special class of limiting processes, called reversible processes, which leave Af unchanged. It turns out that M,. is proportional to the square root of the black hole's area' [see (1)]. Thus Christodoulou's result implies that the area increases in most processes, and thus it supports the conjecture of Floyd and Penrose. Christodoulou's conclusion is also valid  '  for charged Kerr black holes. By an approach radically different from Christodoulou's, Hawking' has given a general proof that the black-hole surface area cannot decrease in any process. For a system of several black holes Hawking's theorem implies that the area of each individual black hole cannot decrease, and more-  over that when two black holes merge, the area of the resulting black hole {provided, of course, that one forms) cannot be smaller than the sum of initial areas. It is clear that changes of a black hole generally take place in the direction of increasing area. This is reminiscent of the second law of thermodynamics which states that changes of a closed thermodynamic system take place in the direction of increasing entropy. The above comparison suggests that it might be useful to consider blackhole physics from a thermodynamic viewpoint: We already have the concept of energy in black-hole physics, and the above observation suggests that something like entropy may also play a role in it. Thus, one can hope to develop a thermodynamics for black holes -at least a rudimentary one. In this paper we show that it is possible to give a precise definition of black-hole entropy. Based on it we construct some elements of a thermodynamics for black holes. There are some precedents to our considerations. The idea of making use of thermodynamic methods in black-hole physics appears to have been first considered by Greif. He examined the possibility of defining the entropy of a black hole, but lacking many of the recent results in black-hole physics, he did not make a concrete proposal. More recently, Carter' has rederived the result of Christodoulou that the irreducible mass of a Kerr black hole is unchanged in a reversible trans-    JACOB D.

' Carter's example shows the possibilities inherent in the use of thermodynamic arguments in black-hole physics. In this paper we attempt a unification of blackIn Sec. II we hole physics with thermodynamics. point out a number of analogies between black-hole all of which bring physics and thermodynamics, out the parallelism between black-hole area and entropy. In Sec. III, after a short review of elements of the theory of information, we discuss some features of black-hole physics from the point of view of information theory. We take the area of a black hole as a measure of its entropy-entropy in the sense of inaccessibility of information about its internal configuration. We go further in Sec. IV and propose a specific expression for black-hole entropy in terms of black-hole area. Earlier"' we had proposed this same expression on different grounds; here we find the value of a previously unknown constant by means of an argument based on information theory. In Sec. V we propose a generalization of the second law of thermodynamics applicable to black-hole physics: When some common entropy goes down a black hole, the blackhole entropy plus the common entropy in the blackhole exterior never decreases In Secs. VI and VII we construct several exp. mples which provide support for the generalized second law. In addition, we analyze in Sec. VII a thought experiment proposed by Geroch" in which, with the help of a black hole, heat is apparently converted entirely into work in violation of the second law. We show that, in fact, due to fundamental physical limitations the conversion efficiency is somewhat smaller than unity. Moreover, the efficiency is no greater than the maximum efficiency allowed by thermodynamics for the heat engine which is equivalent to the Geroch process, so that this process cannot be regarded as violating the second law. II. ANALOGIES BETWEEN BLACK-HOLE PHYSICS AND THERMODYNAMICS  We have already mentioned the resemblance between the tendency of black-hole area to increase, and the tendency of entropy to increase. Changes of a black hole or of a system of black holes select a preferred direction in time: that in which the black-hole area increases. Likewise, changes of a closed thermodynamic system select a preferred direction in time: that in which the entropy increases. This parallelism between black-hole area and entropy goes even deeper.  Black-hole area turns out to be as intimately related to the degradation of energy as is entropy. the statement "the entropy has In thermodynamics increased" implies that a certain quantity of energy has been degraded, i.e. , that it can no longer arear' be transformed into work. Now, as Christodoulou has emphasized, the irreducible mass M of a Kerr black hole, which is related to the surface of the black hole by' represents energy which cannot be extracted by means of Penrose processes. ' In this sense it is inert energy which cannot be transfcrmed into work. Thus, an increase in A, and hence in , corresponds to the degradation (in the thermodynamic sense) of some of the energy of the black hole. The irreducible mass of a Schwarzschild black hole is just equal to its total mass. Thus, no energy can be extracted from such a black hole by means of Penrose processes. However, the merger of two Schwarzschild black holes can yield energy in the form of gravitational waves. The only restriction on the process is that the total blackhole area must not decrease as a result of the merger. ' However, the sum of the irreducible masses of individual black holes may (in fact, does) decrease. We see that for a system of several black holes the degraded energy E„ is more appropriately given by than by PM. . According to this formula the degraded energy of a system of black holes is smaller than the sum of degraded energies of the black holes considered separately. Thus by combining Schwarzschild black holes which are already "dead, one can still obtain energy. Analogously, by allowing two thermodynamic systems which are separately in equilibrium to interact, one can obtain work, whereas each system by itself could have done no work. From the above observations the parallelism between black-hole area and entropy is again evident. We shall now construct the black-hole analog of the thermodynamic expression For convenience we shall from now on write all our equations in terms of the "rationalized area" of a black hole e defined by (4)  BLACK HOLES AND ENTROPY Consider a Kerr black hole of mass M, charge Q, and angular momentum L. (3-vectors here refer to components with respect to the Euclidean frame at infinity. ) Its rationalized area is given by' '  at black-hole physics from the point of view of the theory of information. III. INFORMATION   In (8) we have the black-hole analog of the thermodynamic expression (3): The terms fl dL and clearly represent the work done on the black hole by an external agent who increases the black hole's angular momentum and charge by dL and dQ, respectively. Thus 0 dL+ 4 d@ is the analog of -PdV, the work done on a thermodynamic system. Comparing our expression for work with the expressions for work done on rotating" and charged~ bodies, we see that 0 and 4 play the roles of rotational angular frequency and electric potential of the black hole, respectively. ''9 The a in (8) resembles the entropy S in (3) as we have noted before: For any change of the black hole du ~ 0, ' while for any change of a closed thermodynamic system dS~ 0. Moreover, it is clear from (7) and (9a) that the black-hole analog of temperature T, is non-negative just as T is. From the above observations the formal correspondence between (3) and (8) is evident. All the analogies we have mentioned are suggestive of a connection between thermodynamics and black-hole physics in general, and between entropy and black-hole area in particular. But so far the analogies have been of a purely formal nature, primarily because entropy and area have different dimensions. We shall remedy this deficiency in Sec. IV by constructing out of black-hole area an expression for black-hole entropy with the correct dimensions. Preparatory to this we shall now look   The connection between entropy and information known. The entropy of a system measures one's uncertainty or lack of information about the actual internal configuration of the system. Suppose that all that is known about the internal configuration of a system is that it may be found in any of a number of states with probability p„ for the nth state. Then the entropy associated with the system is given by Shannon's formula"'"  is well  where  AND BLACK-HOLE ENTROPY This formula is uniquely determined by a few very general requirements which are imposed in order that S have the properties expected of a measure of uncertainty. It should be noticed that the above entropy is dimensionless. This simply means that we choose to measure temperature in units of energy. Boltzmann's constant is then dimensionless. Whenever new information about the system becomes available, it may be regarded as imposing some constraints on the probabilities P„. For example, the information may be that several of the P„are, in fact, zero. Such constraints on the p„ always result in a decrease in the entropy function. This property is formalized by the relation where AI is the new information which corresponds to a decrease bS in one's uncertainty about the internal state of the system. Equation (11) is the basis for Brillouin's identification of information with negative entropy. All the above comments apply to such divers systems as a quantity of gas in a box or a telegram. A familiar example of the relation between a gain of information and a decrease in entropy is the following. Some ideal gas in a container is compressed isothermally. It is well known that its entropy decreases. On the other hand, one's information about the internal configuration of the gas increases: After the compression the molecules of the gas are more localized, so that their positions are known with more accuracy than before the compression. The second law of thermodynamics is easily understood in the context of information theory. The entropy of a thermodynamic system which is not in equilibrium increases because information  "  SAC QB D. BEKENSTEIN about the internal configuration of the system is being lost during its evolution as a result of the washing out of the effects of the initial conditions. It is possible for an exterior agent to cause a decrease in the entropy of a system by first acquiring information about the internal configuration of the system. The classic example of this is that of Maxwell's demon. But information is never free. In acquiring information AI about the system, the agent inevitably causes an increase in the entropy of the rest of the universe which exceeds LI. Thus, even though the entropy of the system decreases in accordance with (11), the over-all entropy of the universe increases in the process. The conventional unit of information is the "bit" which may be defined as the information available when the answer to a yes-or-no question is precisely known (zero entropy). According to the scheme (11) a bit is also numerically equal to the maximum entropy that can be associated with a yes-or-no question, i.e. , the entropy when no information whatsoever is available about the answer. One easily finds that the entropy function (10) is maximized when P„=P„,= ~. Thus, in our units, one bit is equal to ln2 of information. Let us now return to our original subject, black holes. In the context of information a black hole is very much like a thermodynamic system. The entropy of a thermodynamic system in equilibrium measures the uncertainty as to which of all its internal configurations compatible with its macroscopic thermodynamic parameters (temperature, pressure, etc. ) is actually realized. Now, just as a thermodynamic system in equilibrium can be completely described macroscopically by a few thermodynamic parameters, so a bare black hole in equilibrium (Kerr black hole) can be completely  entropy inside the black hole. In fact, our blackhole entropy refers to the equivalence class of all black holes which have the same mass, charge, and angular momentum, not to one particular black hole. What are we to take as a measure of this black-hole entropy' The discussion of Sec. II predisposes us to single out black-hole area. But to be more general we shall only assume that the entropy of a black hole, Sbj, , is some monotonically increasing function of its rationalized area:  described (insofar as an exterior observer is concerned) by just three parameters: mass, charge, and angular momentum. ' Black holes in equilibrium having the same set of three parameters may still have different "internal configurations. " For example, one black hole may have been formed by the collapse of a normal star, a second by the collapse of a neutron star, a third by the collapse of a geon. These various alternatives may be regarded as different possible internal configurations of one and the same black hole characterized by their (common) mass, charge, and angular momentum. It is then natural to introduce the concept of black-hole entropy as the measure of the inaccessibility of information (to an exterior observer) as to which particular internal configuration of the black hole is actually realized in a  We mentioned earlier that the possibility of causing a decrease in the entropy of a thermodynamic system goes hand in hand with the possibility of obtaining information about its internal configuration. By contrast, an exterior agent cannot acquire any information about the interior configuration of a black hole. The one-way membrane nature of the event horizon prevents him from doing so. ' Therefore, we do not expect an exterior agent to be able to cause a decrease in the black hole's entropy. Equation (12) is in agreement with this expectation; by Hawking's theorem S» never decreases. Here we have a new piece of evidence in favor of the choice (12). One possible choice for in (12), f(o)cc o. '~' untenable on various grounds. Consider two black holes which start off very distant from each other. Since they interact weakly we can take the total black-hole entropy to be the sum of the Sbj, of each black hole. The black holes now fall together,  "  "  given case. At the outset it should be clear that the blackhole entropy we are speaking of is not the thermal  (12) Although our motivating discussion for the introduction of the concept of the black-hole entropy made use of the specific properties of stationary black holes, we shall take (12) to be valid for any black hole, including a dynamically evolving one, since the surface area is well defined for any black hole. This choice is supported by the following  observations. As mentioned earlier, the entropy of an evolving thermodynamic system increases due to the gradual loss of information which is a consequence of the washing out of the effects of the initial conditions. Now, as a black hole approaches equilibrium, the effects of the initial conditions are also washed out (the black hole loses its hair)'; only mass, charge, and angular momentum are left as determinants of the black hole at late times. We would thus expect that the loss of information about initial peculiarities of the hole will be reflected in a gradual increase in Sbb . And indeed Eq. (12) predicts just this; by Hawking's theorem Sb~ increases monotonically as the black hole evolves. This agreement is evidence in favor of the choice  (12).  f  BLACK HOLES AND ENTROPY merge, and form a black hole which settles down In the process no information to equilibrium. about the black-hole interior can become available; on the contrary, much information is lost as the final black hole "loses its hair. " Thus, we expect the final black-hole entropy to exceed the initial one. By our assumption that f(a)~ a'~~, this implies that the irreducible mass [see (1)] of the final black hole exceeds the sum of irreducible masses of the initial black holes. Now suppose that all three black holes are Schwarzschild (M=M„}. We are then confronted with the prediction that the final black-hole mass exceeds the initial one. But this is nonsense since the total black-hole mass can only decrease due to gravitational radiation losses. We thus see that the choice f(n) ~ a' ' is untenable. The next simplest choice for is  f  (13) where y is a constant. Repetition of the above argument for this new leads to the conclusion that the final black-hole area must exceed the total initial black-hole area. But we know this to be true from Hawking's theorem. ' Thus the choice (13) leads to no contradiction. Therefore, we shall adopt (13) for the moment; later on we shall exhibit some more positive evidence in its favor. Comparison of (12} and (13) shows that y must have the units of (length) . But there is no constant with such units in classical general relativity. If in desperation we appeal to quantum physics we find only one truly universal constant with the correct units'4: 5 ', that is, the reciprocal of the Planck length squared. (Compton wavelengths are not universal, but peculiar to this or that particle; they clearly have no bearing on the problem. ) We are thus compelled to write (12}as  constant which we may g is a dimensionless expect to be of order unity. This expression was first proposed by us earlier"'~ from a different  where  point of view. We need not be alarmed at the appearance of @ in the expression for black-hole entropy. It is well known" that 0 also appears in the formulas for entropy of many thermodynamic systems that are conventionally regarded as classical, for example, the Boltzmann ideal gas. This is a reflection of the fact that entropy is, in a sense, a count of states of the system, and the underlying states of any system are always quantum in nature. It is thus not totally unexpected that 0 appears in (14). These observations also suggest that it would be  somewhat pretentious  to attempt to calculate the  precise value of the constant qk ' without a full understanding of the quantum reality which underlies a "classical" black hole. Since there is no hope at present of obtaining such an understanding, we bypass the issue, and in the next section we use a semiclassical argument to arrive at a value for gS which should be quite close to the correct  '  one. IV. EXPRESSION FOR BLACK-HOLE ENTROPY  In our attempt to obtain a value for qS ' we shall employ the following argument. We imagine that a particle goes down a Kerr black hole. As it disappears some information is lost with it. According to the discussion of Sec. III we expect the blackhole entropy, as the measure of inaccessible information, to reflect the loss of the information associated with the particle by increasing by an appropriate amount. How much information is lost together with the particles The amount clearly depends on how much is known about the internal state of the particle, on the precise way in which the particle falls in, etc. But we can be sure that the absolute minimum of information lost is that contained in the answer to the question "does the particle exist or notV" To start with, the answer is known to be yes. But after the particle falls in, one has no information whatever about the answer. This is because from the point of view of this paper, one knows nothing about the physical conditions inside the black hole, and thus one cannot assess the likelihood of the particle continuing to exist or being destroyed. One must, therefore, admit to the loss of one bit of information (see Sec. IH) at the very least. Our plan, therefore, is to compute the minimum possible increase in the black hole's area which results from the disappearance of a particle down the black hole, then to compute the corresponding minimum possible increase of black-hole entropy by means of our original formula (12), and finally to identify this increase in entropy with the loss of one bit of information in accordanc with the scheme (11}. If our procedure is reasonable we should then recover the functional form of given by (13), together with a definite value for y. There are many ways in which a particle can go down a black hole, all leading to varying increases in black-hole area. We are interested in that method for inserting the particle which results in the smallest increase. This method has already been discussed by Christodoulou' in connection with his introduction of the concept of irreducible mass. The essence of Christodoulou's method is that if a freely falling point particle is captured by  f  '  JACOB D. BEKENSTEIN  2338  a Kerr black hole from a turning point in its orbit, then the irreducible mass and, consequently, the area of the hole are left unchanged. For reasons that will become clear presently we wish to allow the particle to have a nonzero radius. As shown in Appendix A, Christodoulou's method can be generalized easily so as to allow for this, as well a, s for the possibility that the particle is brought to the horizon by some method other than by free fall. We find in Appendix A that the increase in area for the generalized Christodoulou process is no longer precisely zero. But interestingly enough, the minimum increase in rationalized area, (ha) . turns out to be independent of the parameters of the black hole. For a spherical particle of rest mass and proper radius b, For a point particle (Aa) min =0; this is Christodoulou's result. Expression (15) gives the minimum possible increase in black-hole area that results if a given particle is added to a Kerr black hole. We can try to make (Aa) smaller by making 5 smaller. However, we must remember that b can be no smaller than the particle's Compton wavelength , or than its gravitational radius 2p. , whichever is the larger. The Compton wavelength is the larger for p. ~2 '~'5' ', and the gravitational radius is the larger for p&2 '~')I' (2 ' 'g' ~10 'g) ~, then 2p, b can be as small as Thus, if p, ~2 ' 2php '=2@. But if g&2 ' 'K' ', then 2p. b can be no smaller than 4g'&2k. We conclude that quantum effects set a lower bound of M on the increase of the rationalized area of a Kerr black hole when it captures a particle. Moreover, this limit can be reached only for a particle whose dimension is given by its Compton wavelength. Of course, only such an "elementary particle" can be regarded as having no internal structure. Therefore, the loss of information associated with the loss of such a particle should be minimum. And indeed we find that the increase in b1ack-hole entropy is smallest for just such a, particle. This supports our view that 2h is the increase in rationalized area associated with the loss of one bit of information. Following our program we shall equate the minimum increase in black-hole entropy, (AS») . =2ffdf/da, with ln2, the entropy increase associated with the loss of one bit of information. Integration of the resulting equation gives f(a) =(—,' In2)A' 'a. Thus, we have arrived again at (13} by an alternate route, and have obtained the value of y into the bargain. We now have   is of the same form as (14). Our argument has determined the dependence of S» on a in a straightforward manner. However, our value q = &ln2 might presumably be challenged on the grounds that it follows from the assumption that the smallest possible radius of a particle is precisely equal to its Compton wavelength whereas the actual radius is not so sharply defined. Nevertheless, it should be clear that if g is not exactly ' —, ln2, then it must be very close to this, probably within a factor of two. This slight uncertainty in the value of g is the price we pay for not giving our problem a full quantum treatment. However, in what follows we shall suppose that g= & ln2. Examples to be given later will show that this value leads to no contradictions. How is the entropy of a system of several black holes defined& It is natural to define it as the sum of individual black-hole entropies. Then Hawking's theorem tells us that the total black-hole entropy of the system cannot decrease. But this is just what we would expect since the information lost down the black holes is unrecoverable. This observation lends support to our choice. In conventional units (16) takes the form  where k is Boltzmann's constant. We see that the entropy of a black hole is enormous. For exa, mple, a black hole of one solar mass would have S»=&0 erg'K '. By comparison the entropy of the sun is S=10~erg'K ', those of a white dwarf or a neutron star of one solar mass even smaller. The large numerical value of black-hole entropy serves to dramatize the highly irreversible character of the process of black-hole formation. We may define a characteristic tempera, ture for a Kerr black hole by the relation T» ' =(SSb/Shf)~i e which is the analog of the thermodynamic relation T ' full.   where r, and a are to be given in centimeters. We introduce this Tb„ in anticipation of our discussion of an example in Sec. VG. But we emphasize that one should not regard T» as the temperature of the black hole; such an identification can easily lead to all sorts of paradoxes, and is thus not use-  BLACK HOLES AND ENTROPY V. THE GENERALIZED SECOND LAW  Suppose that a body containing some common entropy goes down a black hole. The entropy of the visible universe decreases in the process. It would seem that the second law of thermodynamics is transcended here in the sense that an exterior observer can never verify by direct measurement that the total entropy of the whole universe does not decrease in 6e process. However, we know that the black-hole area "compensates" for the disappearance of the body by increasing irreversibly. It is thus natural to conjecture that the second law is not really transcended provided that it is expressed in a generalized form: The common entropy in the black-hole exterior plus the blackhole entropy never decreases. This statement means that we must regard black-hole entropy as a genuine contribution to the entropy content of the  "  universe. Support for the above version of the second law comes from the following argument. Suppose that a body carrying entropy S goes down a black hole (which may have existed previously or may be formed by the collapse of the body). The S is the uncertainty in one's knowledge of the internal configuration of the body. So long as the body was still outside the black hole, one had the option of removing this uncertainty by carrying out measurements and obtaining information up to the amount S. But once the body has fallen in, this option is lost; the information about the internal configuration of the body becomes truly inaccessible. We thus expect the black-hole entropy, as the measure of inaccessible information, to increase by an amount S. Actually, the increase in S» may be even larger because any information that was available about the body to start with will also be lost down the black hole. Therefore, if we denote by b, S, the change in common entropy in the black-hole exterior (AS, = -S), then we expect that  This is just the generalized second law which we proposed above: The generalized entropy S»+S, never decreases. Examples supporting this law will be given in Sec. VI-VII. This is a good place to mention the question of fluctuations. We know that the common entropy of a closed thermodynamic system can decrease spontaneously as a result of statistical fluctuations, i.e. , the second law, being a statistical law, is meaningful only if statistical fluctuations are small. Is black-ho)e entropy also subject to decreases of a statistical nature 7 Not classically — Hawking's theorem guarantees that. Quantum mechanically  2339  there are two ways by which the black-hole entropy can undergo statistical decreases. One of them depends on the quantum fluctuations of the metric of the black hole which one has reasons to expect. ' Such fluctuations would be reflected in small random fluctuations in the area, and thus in the entropy of the black hole, and some of these fluctuations would be expected to be decreases in entropy. However, even if one regards a black hole as a purely classical object, it is still possible for its area and entropy to undergo small decreases when the black hole absorbs a single quantum under certain conditions. However, the probability of such an event occurring in any given trial is very small. Therefore, the decrease in area and entropy is of a statistical nature, and is quite analogous to the decrease in entropy of a thermodynamic system due to statistical fluctuations. This discussion serves us warning that the law (19) is expected to hold only insofar as statistical fluctuations are negligible. We noticed earlier (Sec. IV) the very large magnitude of black-hole entropy. In fact, one can say that the black-hole state is the maximum entropy state of a given amount of matter. The point is that in the gravitational collapse of a body into a black hole, the loss of information down the black hole is the maximum allowed by the laws of physics. Thus if the body collapses to form a Kerr black hole, all information about it is lost with the exception of mass, charge, and angular momentum. ' These quantities are given in terms of Gaussian integrals, ~ and so information about them cannot be lost. But all other information about the body is eventually lost. Therefore, the resulting black hole must correspond to the maximum (generalized) entropy which can be associated with ihe  "  given body. VI. EXAMPLES OF THE GENERALIZED SECOND LAW AT WORK  In the examples which follow we endeavor to subject the generalized second law to the most stringent test possible in each case by maximizing the entropy going down the black hole with a given body while minimizing the associated increase in black -hole entropy. A. Harmonic Oscillator  As a first example we take an harmonic oscilla-  tor composed of two particles of rest mass yn each connected by a nearly massless spring of spring constant K. We imagine the oscillator to be enclosed in a spherical box and to be maintained at temperature T. %'e assume for simplicity that conditions are such that the oscillator  JACOB D. BEKENSTEIN 	There are a number of similarities between black-hole physics and thermodynamics. Most striking is the similarity in the behaviors of black-hole area and of entropy: Both quantities tend to increase irreversibly. In this paper we make this similarity the basis of a thermodynamic approach to black-hole physics. After a brief review of the elements of the theory of information, we discuss black-hole physics from the point of view of information theory. We show that it is natural to introduce the concept of black-hole entropy as the measure of information about a black-hole interior which is inaccessible to an exterior observer. Considerations of simplicity and consistency, and dimensional arguments indicate that the black-hole entropy is equal to the ratio of the black-hole area to the square of the Planck length times a dimensionless constant of order unity. A different approach making use of the specific properties of Kerr black holes and of concepts from information theory leads to the same conclusion, and suggests a definite value for the constant. The physical content of the concept of black-hole entropy derives from the following generalized version of the second law: When common entropy goes down a black hole, the common entropy in the black-hole exterior plus the black-hole entropy never decreases. The validity of this version of the second law is supported by an argument from information theory as well as by several examples.	Jacob D. Bekensteing
7	Paper5_2	1973	Black Holes and Entropy*	 Let ru be the vibrational frequency of the oscillator. Then the (normalized) probability that the oscillator is in its nth quantum state is given by the canonical distribution  is nonrelativistic   The entropy of the oscillator as computed from   We remark that the thermal distribution (20) maximizes the entropy of the oscillator for given (E), and is thus ideally suited to our plan for subjecting the generalized second law to the most stringent test possible. Suppose that the box goes down a Kerr black hole. The corresponding increase in black-hole entropy cannot be smaller than the lowest limit derived by the method of Appendix A. From (15) and (16) we have h, S»- p, bk ' ln2, where 5 is the outer radius of the box and p. is its total rest mass. Clearly & must be at least as large as half of the mean value (y) of the separation of the two masses y. And (y) in turn must clearly be larger than dy, the root mean square of the thermal oscillation of   tive. Now according to the (quantum) virial theorem a(E) is equal to the mean potential energy of because the box self must have some mass) we obtain  We assume that the entropy given by (21) is the only contribution to the entropy in the box. This amounts to neglecting the contribution of the black body radiation in the box, etc. , a sensible procedure if T is not very high. Then AS, = -S and we  have   Our assumption that the oscillator is nonrelativistic means that f»1, and hence that x»2ln2. Under these conditions the minimum is positive (in fact, it is positive for $&1). It follows immediately that 6(Sb„+S,} is positive for all x and all ( which are compatible with the requirement of a nonrelativistic oscillator. The generalized second law is obeyed over the entire regime for which our  treatment is valid. B. Beam of Light  As a second example we consider a beam of light which is aimed at a Kerr black hole. This example  is particularly interesting because it shall bring us face to face with the issue of fluctuations as a limitation on the applicability of the second law. We shall restrict our attention only to those cases for which geometrical optics is a valid approximation. We shall thus represent the path of the beam by a null geodesic in the Kerr background. We shall take it that the beam is thermalized at a certain temperature T. This implies that its entropy is a maximum for given energy. The entropy is easily calculated; in fact, the entropy and energy for each mode in the beam are given by the same expressions (21) and (22) which apply to a, harmonic oscillator, except that one must omit the zeropoint energy term 2k'. The total entropy S and mean energy (E) of the beam are obtained by integrating these expressions weighed by the conventional density of states   over all v. In (25) V is the volume of the beam and dQ is the solid angle it subtends. Integrating by parts the expression for S, one easily obtains  BLACK HOLES AND ENTROPY the relation  turned out to be impossible for ~d, S, to exceed 4S», and so a violation of the second law was ruled out. But there is a way to circumvent the restriction on T. One simply selects the temperature T (arbitrarily) to be as small as one pleases, and arranges for all frequencies e&~,' to be filtered out of the beam. Here ~,'»M ' is a definite frequency unrelated to T. It should be clear that geometrical optics will be a valid approximation for this case also, so that we may take over the result (28). But the result (27) must be modified since we are here dealing with a truncated frequency spectrum. We are mostly interested in the regime T«ke, Then for all frequencies in the beam x=k&u/T» 1. It follows from (21) and (22) that for each mode the entropy to energy ratio  Therefore instead of (27} we have ~  (26) which, not surprisingly, is identical to that for radiation inside a black-body cavity of temperature T. [In Ref. 12 (26) was given with an incorrect numerical factor. ] As the beam nears the black hole, it is deflected by the gravitational field. Insofar as its effects on electromagnetic radiation are concerned, a stationary gravitational field can be mocked up by an appropriate nonabsorbing refractive medium in flat spacetime. But the propagation of a beam of light through such a medium is a reversible process. We infer from this that the entropy of the beam will remain unchanged as the beam nears the black hole. Thus the entropy change of the visible universe when the beam goes down the hole is just   It the increase in black-hole entropy associated with the process? From (8) we see that the increase in n is minimized when the angular momentum that the hole gains from the beam is maximized for given (E) . Now, the gain in angular momentum is limited because the beam will not be captured if it carries too much angular momentum. In Appendix B we take this into account in calculating (in the geometrical optics limit} the minimum possible increase in a for given (E) of the beam. We find that hn&PM(E) where P ranges from 8 for the case of a Schwarzschild hole to 4(I-v 3/2) for the case of an extreme Kerr hole, this last value being the smallest possible P. From (16) it follows that Our assumption (Appendix B) that geometrical optics is always applicable means that the bulk of wavelengths in the beam are much shor ter than the characteristic dimension of the hole =M. Thus, if cu, is some characteristic frequency in the beam, then we require that »M '. From the form of the Planck spectrum (22) we see that II~, ~T; therefore (27) tells us that  Comparison of (28) and (29) shows that a violation of the generalized second law (19) cannot arise in the regime under consideration. In the above discussion the condition that geometrical optics be applicable prevented us from taking T to be arbitrarily small. As a result it  now   appears that if  then AS»+AS, will be negative in contradiction with the generalized second law. The resolution of the above paradox is that in the regime 7& 7, statistical fluctuations are already dominant so that our entire picture of the process is invalid. To verify the importance of fluctuations we calculate the mean number of quanta N in the beam by integrating the mean number of quanta per mode, (e*-1) ', weighed by the density of states (25) over all ~&&u, For T = T, we get (recall that /f&u,'/T, 1 by our assumptions)  any beam aimed at the black hole dQ/4g«1. Recalling that M~,'»1 by assumption, we see from (31) that each quantum occupies a mean volume much larger than M'. But the cross section of the beam must be smaller than -M2 if the beam is to go down the black hole. Thus the mean separation between quanta is much larger than M, the characteristic dimension of the black hole. In case T& T, the above effect is even more accentuated. We conclude that in the regime T&T, for which the second law (19}appears to break down, our description of the process as a continuous beam going down the black hole is invalidated by the large fluctuations in the concentration of energy in the beam (or equivalently, the large fluctuations in the energy of each section of the beam). In this  JACOB D. B EKE NSTEIN regime (E) is no longer a good measure of the actual energy. It appears, therefore, that statistical fluctuations are responsible for the breakdown of the second law in the context in which we have applied it here. But we can demonstrate that the law has not lost all its meaning by adopting a point of view more suitable to the circumstances at hand than the one used above. We take the point of view that quanta are going down the black hole one at a time, rather than in a continuous stream. Thus we must check the validity of the generalized second law for the infall of each quantum. The analysis of Appendix B still leads to formula (28) for the increase in blackhole entropy except that (E) is replaced by Nor, To compute the the energy of the quantum. common entropy going down the black hole we reason as follows. From our point of view a quantum of definite frequency is going down the black hole. Thus we are no longer dealing with the probability distribution (20); instead we shall ascribe probability 2 to each of the two possible polarizations of the quantum. Then according to (10) the entropy associated with the quantum is ln2.  Therefore,  The box under consideration must have a nonzero radius (see below). Because of this its energy as measured from infinity is never quite zero when it is as close to the horizon as it can possibly be. We shall assume that the box is in the shape of a sphere of radius b. Then according to the  E =2pbe, where 6 is defined by (9a). It follows that in lowering the box from infinity to the horizon, the agent obtains only work g(l-2b6) rather than p. After the box has radiated into the black hole, its rest mass becomes p, —b, p and according to (33) its energy at the horizon is just 2(p-b. g)b6. Thus the agent must do work (p, —b, g) (1-2b6) to retrieve the box to infinity where its energy is Therefore, in the over-all process the agent obtains net work b, p(1-2b6) in exchange for the expenditure of heat hp, . The efficiency of conversion is   Since ~P ~ 0.268, and since we are assuming that we see that AS»+AS, is in fact positive: The generalized second law is upheld for the infall of each quantum. VII. A PERPETUAL MOTION MACHINE USING A BLACK HOLE?  Geroch" has described a procedure using a black hole which appears to violate the second law of thermodynamics by converting heat into work with unit efficiency. He envisages a box filled with black-body radiation which is slowly lowered by means of a string from far away down to the horizon of a black hole, at which point its energy as measured from infinity vanishes. Therefore, if the box's rest mass is p. , then the agent lowering the string obtains work equal to p. out of the process. The box is then allowed to emit into the black-hole radiation of (proper) energy Ap. . Finally, the agent retrieves the box; since its rest mass is now p, -6p. , he must do work p, -Ap to accomplish this. Therefore, in the whole process the agent obtains net work 6p, at the expense of heat 6 p, —conversion with unit efficiency. We shall now show that, in fact, due to fundamental physical limitations, the efficiency of the Geroch process is slightly smaller than unity, so that no violation of the second law is entailed here.

In practical situations and the efficiency can be quite But the departure of ~ from unity,  be«1  albeit small, serves to resolve the problem raised by Geroch's example: There is no violation of the Kelvin statement of the second law. We must now explain why b cannot be arbitrarily small. Physically the reason is that the box must be large enough for the wavelengths characteristic  "  of radiation of some temperature T to fit into we can argue as follows. The frequency of the photon ground state associated with the box, coo, cannot exceed that frequency co~ at which the Planck photon-number spectrum  it. More formally    peaks. Otherwise the frequencies of all photon states would lie in the exponential tail of the spectrum, the occupation number of each state would be small, and the resulting large fluctuations would make the concept of temperature meaningless. We have the conventional relation w, b'= w, where b' is the interior radius of the box (b'& b), and we easily find that h(d~&2T. Therefore, cu, & ~~ implies that b& wk/2T. It is thus clear that there is a lower limit for b. We may write the efficiency (34) in a more transparent form by recalling that 6 = a T „ In2/5 [see (18)], where T~„ is the characteristic temperature associated with the black hole. Since b&wh/2T we  BLACK HOLES AND ENTROPY find that  We now recall that the efficiency of a heat engine operating between two reservoirs, one at temperature T and the second at temperature T»& T, is restricted by e &1-T»/T. We thus see that the Geroch process is no more efficient than its  "  This obser"equivalent reversible heat engine. vation makes it evident again that Geroch's process is not in violation of the second law of thermodynamics. Finally, we wish to remark that since our primary formula (33}is valid only when the box is small compared to the black hole (be«1), we can vouch for the validity of (35) only when T»«T. However, due to the smallness of T» this condition will be satisfied in all cases of practical  interest. We now verify that the Geroch process is in accord with the generalized second law (19). We mentioned earlier that the agent obtains work a p(1-259) for a decrease A p in the rest mass of the box. This means that the black hole's mass must increase by 2A pb8 in the complete process. According to (6) and (16) the corresponding increase in black hole entropy is AS»=h, p. M ln2 (angular momentum is not added to the hole; see Appendix C).

As pointed out by Christodoulou this increase vanishes only if the particle is captured from a turning point in its orbit in which case ( p, n. (, =0. In this case we have  Here v-e have already assumed that the particle reaches a turning point as it is captured since we know that this minimizes the increase in blackhole area. Equation (A12} is the generalization to 0(b} of the Christodoulou condition (A10). What is q in (A12}'P We can obtain a lower bound for it as follows. From the requirement that the 8 momentum Pe be real it follows that   The above analysis shows that it is possible for a black hole to capture a point particle without increasing its area. How is this conclusion changed if the particle has a nonzero proper radius b? First we note that regardless of the manner in which the particle arrives at the horizon (being lowered by a string, splitting off from a second particle which then escapes, etc ), it mus. t clearly acquire its parameters E, p&, and q while every part of it is still outside the horizon, i.e. , while it is not yet part of the black hole. Moreover, as the particle is captured, it must already be detached from whatever system brought it to the horizon, so that it may be regarded as falling freely. Therefore, Eq.

Substituting this into (A12) we find which   Here we shall calculate the minimum possible increase in black-hole area which must result when a light beam of energy E &0 coming from infinity is captured by a Kerr black hole. If the black hole is nonrotating the increase is simply obtained by setting dM=E in (8):  A, 0. can be minimized by maximizing the angular momentum P which is brought in by the beam [see (8)]. To accomplish this we consider the effective potential V for the motion of a massless particle in a Kerr background. This V is just the value of E given by (A6) regarded as a function of for p=0 and P, =0 (E equals V at a turning point). This potential starts off at a value QPz at r=r+ (see Appendix A), increases with r, reaches a maximum, and then falls off to zero as For the beam to be captured by the hole it is necessary that p& be small enough for the peak of the potential barrier to be smaller than E of the beam. The optimum case we seek corresponds to the peak being just equal to E so that P& has its largest possible value. It is clear that we must take q in (A6) as small as possible in order to have the lowest possible potential peak for given p&. Let us first take q & 0. Then according to Carter" there are solutions to the geodesic equation only if (pz(& aE. From (8)    It is clear that for q&0 the potential peak will be higher and the increase in area will be larger than the one given by (B3).

P. Abbott et al.* (LIGO Scientific Collaboration and Virgo Collaboration) (Received 21 January 2016; published 11 February 2016) On September 14, 2015 at 09:50:45 UTC the two detectors of the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory simultaneously observed a transient gravitational-wave signal. The signal sweeps upwards in frequency from 35 to 250 Hz with a peak gravitational-wave strain of 1.0 × 10−21 . It matches the waveform predicted by general relativity for the inspiral and merger of a pair of black holes and the ringdown of the resulting single black hole. The signal was observed with a matched-filter signal-to-noise ratio of 24 and a false alarm rate estimated to be less than 1 event per 203 000 years, equivalent to a significance greater þ0.03 than 5.1σ. The source lies at a luminosity distance of 410þ160 −180 Mpc corresponding to a redshift z ¼ 0.09 In the source frame, the initial black hole masses are 36−4 M⊙ and 29−4 M ⊙ , and the final black hole mass is −4 M ⊙ , with 3.0−0.5 M ⊙ c radiated in gravitational waves. All uncertainties define 90% credible intervals. These observations demonstrate the existence of binary stellar-mass black hole systems. This is the first direct detection of gravitational waves and the first observation of a binary black hole merger. I. INTRODUCTION In 1916, the year after the final formulation of the field equations of general relativity, Albert Einstein predicted the existence of gravitational waves. He found that the linearized weak-field equations had wave solutions: transverse waves of spatial strain that travel at the speed of light, generated by time variations of the mass quadrupole moment of the source [1,2]. Einstein understood that gravitational-wave amplitudes would be remarkably small; moreover, until the Chapel Hill conference in 1957 there was significant debate about the physical reality of gravitational waves [3]. Also in 1916, Schwarzschild published a solution for the field equations [4] that was later understood to describe a black hole [5,6], and in 1963 Kerr generalized the solution to rotating black holes [7]. Starting in the 1970s theoretical work led to the understanding of black hole quasinormal modes [8–10], and in the 1990s higher-order postNewtonian calculations [11] preceded extensive analytical studies of relativistic two-body dynamics [12,13]. These advances, together with numerical relativity breakthroughs in the past decade [14–16], have enabled modeling of binary black hole mergers and accurate predictions of their gravitational waveforms. While numerous black hole candidates have now been identified through electromagnetic observations [17–19], black hole mergers have not previously been observed. *  Full author list given at the end of the article.

This discovery, along with emerging astrophysical understanding [22], led to the recognition that direct observations of the amplitude and phase of gravitational waves would enable studies of additional relativistic systems and provide new tests of general relativity, especially in the dynamic strong-field regime. Experiments to detect gravitational waves began with Weber and his resonant mass detectors in the 1960s [23], followed by an international network of cryogenic resonant detectors [24]. Interferometric detectors were first suggested in the early 1960s [25] and the 1970s [26]. A study of the noise and performance of such detectors [27], and further concepts to improve them [28], led to proposals for long-baseline broadband laser interferometers with the potential for significantly increased sensitivity [29–32]. By the early 2000s, a set of initial detectors was completed, including TAMA 300 in Japan, GEO 600 in Germany, the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO) in the United States, and Virgo in Italy. Combinations of these detectors made joint observations from 2002 through 2011, setting upper limits on a variety of gravitational-wave sources while evolving into a global network. In 2015, Advanced LIGO became the first of a significantly more sensitive network of advanced detectors to begin observations [33–36]. A century after the fundamental predictions of Einstein and Schwarzschild, we report the first direct detection of gravitational waves and the first direct observation of a binary black hole system merging to form a single black hole.

II. OBSERVATION On September 14, 2015 at 09:50:45 UTC, the LIGO Hanford, WA, and Livingston, LA, observatories detected  week ending 12 FEBRUARY 2016  the coincident signal GW150914 shown in Fig. 1. The initial detection was made by low-latency searches for generic gravitational-wave transients [41] and was reported within three minutes of data acquisition [43]. Subsequently, matched-filter analyses that use relativistic models of compact binary waveforms [44] recovered GW150914 as the most significant event from each detector for the observations reported here. Occurring within the 10-ms intersite  FIG. 1. The gravitational-wave event GW150914 observed by the LIGO Hanford (H1, left column panels) and Livingston (L1, right column panels) detectors. Times are shown relative to September 14, 2015 at 09:50:45 UTC. For visualization, all time series are filtered with a 35–350 Hz bandpass filter to suppress large fluctuations outside the detectors’ most sensitive frequency band, and band-reject filters to remove the strong instrumental spectral lines seen in the Fig. 3 spectra.

Top row, right: L1 strain. þ0.5 GW150914 arrived first at L1 and 6.9−0.4 ms later at H1; for a visual comparison, the H1 data are also shown, shifted in time by this amount and inverted (to account for the detectors’ relative orientations). Second row: Gravitational-wave strain projected onto each detector in the 35–350 Hz band. Solid lines show a numerical relativity waveform for a system with parameters consistent with those recovered from GW150914 [37,38] confirmed to 99.9% by an independent calculation based on [15]. Shaded areas show 90% credible regions for two independent waveform reconstructions. One (dark gray) models the signal using binary black hole template waveforms [39]. The other (light gray) does not use an astrophysical model, but instead calculates the strain signal as a linear combination of sine-Gaussian wavelets [40,41]. These reconstructions have a 94% overlap, as shown in [39]. Third row: Residuals after subtracting the filtered numerical relativity waveform from the filtered detector time series.

Only the LIGO detectors were observing at the time of GW150914. The Virgo detector was being upgraded, and GEO 600, though not sufficiently sensitive to detect this event, was operating but not in observational mode. With only two detectors the source position is primarily determined by the relative arrival time and localized to an area of approximately 600 deg2 (90% credible region) [39,46]. The basic features of GW150914 point to it being produced by the coalescence of two black holes—i.e., their orbital inspiral and merger, and subsequent final black hole ringdown. Over 0.2 s, the signal increases in frequency and amplitude in about 8 cycles from 35 to 150 Hz, where the amplitude reaches a maximum. The most plausible explanation for this evolution is the inspiral of two orbiting masses, m1 and m2 , due to gravitational-wave emission. At the lower frequencies, such evolution is characterized by the chirp mass [11] where f and f_ are the observed frequency and its time derivative and G and c are the gravitational constant and speed of light. Estimating f and f_ from the data in Fig. 1, we obtain a chirp mass of M ≃ 30M⊙ , implying that the total mass M ¼ m1 þ m2 is ≳70M ⊙ in the detector frame. This bounds the sum of the Schwarzschild radii of the binary components to 2GM=c2 ≳ 210 km. To reach an orbital frequency of 75 Hz (half the gravitational-wave frequency) the objects must have been very close and very compact; equal Newtonian point masses orbiting at this frequency would be only ≃350 km apart. A pair of neutron stars, while compact, would not have the required mass, while a black hole neutron star binary with the deduced chirp mass would have a very large total mass, and would thus merge at much lower frequency. This leaves black holes as the only known objects compact enough to reach an orbital frequency of 75 Hz without contact. Furthermore, the decay of the waveform after it peaks is consistent with the damped oscillations of a black hole relaxing to a final stationary Kerr configuration. Below, we present a general-relativistic analysis of GW150914; Fig. 2 shows the calculated waveform using the resulting source parameters. III. DETECTORS Gravitational-wave astronomy exploits multiple, widely separated detectors to distinguish gravitational waves from local instrumental and environmental noise, to provide source sky localization, and to measure wave polarizations. The LIGO sites each operate a single Advanced LIGO  FIG. 2. Top: Estimated gravitational-wave strain amplitude from GW150914 projected onto H1. This shows the full bandwidth of the waveforms, without the filtering used for Fig. 1. The inset images show numerical relativity models of the black hole horizons as the black holes coalesce.

Each arm is formed by two mirrors, acting as test masses, separated by Lx ¼ Ly ¼ L ¼ 4 km. A passing gravitational wave effectively alters the arm lengths such that the measured difference is ΔLðtÞ ¼ δLx − δLy ¼ hðtÞL, where h is the gravitational-wave strain amplitude projected onto the detector. This differential length variation alters the phase difference between the two light fields returning to the beam splitter, transmitting an optical signal proportional to the gravitational-wave strain to the output photodetector. To achieve sufficient sensitivity to measure gravitational waves, the detectors include several enhancements to the basic Michelson interferometer. First, each arm contains a resonant optical cavity, formed by its two test mass mirrors, that multiplies the effect of a gravitational wave on the light phase by a factor of 300 [48]. Second, a partially transmissive power-recycling mirror at the input provides additional resonant buildup of the laser light in the interferometer as a whole [49,50]: 20 W of laser input is increased to 700 W incident on the beam splitter, which is further increased to 100 kW circulating in each arm cavity. Third, a partially transmissive signal-recycling mirror at the output optimizes FIG. 3. Simplified diagram of an Advanced LIGO detector (not to scale). A gravitational wave propagating orthogonally to the detector plane and linearly polarized parallel to the 4-km optical cavities will have the effect of lengthening one 4-km arm and shortening the other during one half-cycle of the wave; these length changes are reversed during the other half-cycle. The output photodetector records these differential cavity length variations. While a detector’s directional response is maximal for this case, it is still significant for most other angles of incidence or polarizations (gravitational waves propagate freely through the Earth). Inset (a): Location and orientation of the LIGO detectors at Hanford, WA (H1) and Livingston, LA (L1). Inset (b): The instrument noise for each detector near the time of the signal detection; this is an amplitude spectral density, expressed in terms of equivalent gravitational-wave strain amplitude. The sensitivity is limited by photon shot noise at frequencies above 150 Hz, and by a superposition of other noise sources at lower frequencies [47]. Narrow-band features include calibration lines (33–38, 330, and 1080 Hz), vibrational modes of suspension fibers (500 Hz and harmonics), and 60 Hz electric power grid harmonics.  the gravitational-wave signal extraction by broadening the bandwidth of the arm cavities [51,52]. The interferometer is illuminated with a 1064-nm wavelength Nd:YAG laser, stabilized in amplitude, frequency, and beam geometry [53,54]. The gravitational-wave signal is extracted at the output port using a homodyne readout [55]. These interferometry techniques are designed to maximize the conversion of strain to optical signal, thereby minimizing the impact of photon shot noise (the principal noise at high frequencies). High strain sensitivity also requires that the test masses have low displacement noise, which is achieved by isolating them from seismic noise (low frequencies) and designing them to have low thermal noise (intermediate frequencies). Each test mass is suspended as the final stage of a quadruple-pendulum system [56], supported by an active seismic isolation platform [57]. These systems collectively provide more than 10 orders of magnitude of isolation from ground motion for frequencies above 10 Hz. Thermal noise is minimized by using low-mechanical-loss materials in the test masses and their  suspensions: the test masses are 40-kg fused silica substrates with low-loss dielectric optical coatings [58,59], and are suspended with fused silica fibers from the stage above [60]. To minimize additional noise sources, all components other than the laser source are mounted on vibration isolation stages in ultrahigh vacuum. To reduce optical phase fluctuations caused by Rayleigh scattering, the pressure in the 1.2-m diameter tubes containing the armcavity beams is maintained below 1 μPa. Servo controls are used to hold the arm cavities on resonance [61] and maintain proper alignment of the optical components [62]. The detector output is calibrated in strain by measuring its response to test mass motion induced by photon pressure from a modulated calibration laser beam [63]. The calibration is established to an uncertainty (1σ) of less than 10% in amplitude and 10 degrees in phase, and is continuously monitored with calibration laser excitations at selected frequencies. Two alternative methods are used to validate the absolute calibration, one referenced to the main laser wavelength and the other to a radio-frequency oscillator [64]. Additionally, the detector response to gravitational waves is tested by injecting simulated waveforms with the calibration laser. To monitor environmental disturbances and their influence on the detectors, each observatory site is equipped with an array of sensors: seismometers, accelerometers, microphones, magnetometers, radio receivers, weather sensors, ac-power line monitors, and a cosmic-ray detector [65]. Another ∼105 channels record the interferometer’s operating point and the state of the control systems. Data collection is synchronized to Global Positioning System (GPS) time to better than 10 μs [66]. Timing accuracy is verified with an atomic clock and a secondary GPS receiver at each observatory site. In their most sensitive band, 100–300 Hz, the current LIGO detectors are 3 to 5 times more sensitive to strain than initial LIGO [67]; at lower frequencies, the improvement is even greater, with more than ten times better sensitivity below 60 Hz. Because the detectors respond proportionally to gravitational-wave amplitude, at low redshift the volume of space to which they are sensitive increases as the cube of strain sensitivity. For binary black holes with masses similar to GW150914, the space-time volume surveyed by the observations reported here surpasses previous observations by an order of magnitude [68]. IV. DETECTOR VALIDATION Both detectors were in steady state operation for several hours around GW150914. All performance measures, in particular their average sensitivity and transient noise behavior, were typical of the full analysis period [69,70]. Exhaustive investigations of instrumental and environmental disturbances were performed, giving no evidence to suggest that GW150914 could be an instrumental artifact [69]. The detectors’ susceptibility to environmental disturbances was quantified by measuring their response to specially generated magnetic, radio-frequency, acoustic, and vibration excitations. These tests indicated that any external disturbance large enough to have caused the observed signal would have been clearly recorded by the array of environmental sensors. None of the environmental sensors recorded any disturbances that evolved in time and frequency like GW150914, and all environmental fluctuations during the second that contained GW150914 were too small to account for more than 6% of its strain amplitude. Special care was taken to search for long-range correlated disturbances that might produce nearly simultaneous signals at the two sites. No significant disturbances were found. The detector strain data exhibit non-Gaussian noise transients that arise from a variety of instrumental mechanisms. Many have distinct signatures, visible in auxiliary data channels that are not sensitive to gravitational waves; such instrumental transients are removed from our analyses [69]. Any instrumental transients that remain in the data are accounted for in the estimated detector backgrounds  described below. There is no evidence for instrumental transients that are temporally correlated between the two detectors. V. SEARCHES We present the analysis of 16 days of coincident observations between the two LIGO detectors from September 12 to October 20, 2015. This is a subset of the data from Advanced LIGO’s first observational period that ended on January 12, 2016. GW150914 is confidently detected by two different types of searches. One aims to recover signals from the coalescence of compact objects, using optimal matched filtering with waveforms predicted by general relativity. The other search targets a broad range of generic transient signals, with minimal assumptions about waveforms. These searches use independent methods, and their response to detector noise consists of different, uncorrelated, events. However, strong signals from binary black hole mergers are expected to be detected by both searches. Each search identifies candidate events that are detected at both observatories consistent with the intersite propagation time. Events are assigned a detection-statistic value that ranks their likelihood of being a gravitational-wave signal. The significance of a candidate event is determined by the search background—the rate at which detector noise produces events with a detection-statistic value equal to or higher than the candidate event. Estimating this background is challenging for two reasons: the detector noise is nonstationary and non-Gaussian, so its properties must be empirically determined; and it is not possible to shield the detector from gravitational waves to directly measure a signal-free background. The specific procedure used to estimate the background is slightly different for the two searches, but both use a time-shift technique: the time stamps of one detector’s data are artificially shifted by an offset that is large compared to the intersite propagation time, and a new set of events is produced based on this time-shifted data set. For instrumental noise that is uncorrelated between detectors this is an effective way to estimate the background. In this process a gravitationalwave signal in one detector may coincide with time-shifted noise transients in the other detector, thereby contributing to the background estimate. This leads to an overestimate of the noise background and therefore to a more conservative assessment of the significance of candidate events. The characteristics of non-Gaussian noise vary between different time-frequency regions. This means that the search backgrounds are not uniform across the space of signals being searched. To maximize sensitivity and provide a better estimate of event significance, the searches sort both their background estimates and their event candidates into different classes according to their time-frequency morphology. The significance of a candidate event is measured against the background of its class. To account for having searched multiple classes, this significance is decreased by a trials factor equal to the number of classes [71]. A. Generic transient search Designed to operate without a specific waveform model, this search identifies coincident excess power in timefrequency representations of the detector strain data [43,72], for signal frequencies up to 1 kHz and durations up to a few seconds. The search reconstructs signal waveforms consistent with a common gravitational-wave signal in both detectors using a multidetector maximum likelihood method. Each ranked according to the detection statistic where Ec is the dimensionless coherent signal energy obtained by cross-correlating the two reconstructed waveforms, and En is the dimensionless residual noise energy after the reconstructed signal is subtracted from the data. The statistic ηc thus quantifies the SNR of the event and the consistency of the data between the two detectors. Based on their time-frequency morphology, the events are divided into three mutually exclusive search classes, as described in [41]: events with time-frequency morphology of known populations of noise transients (class C1), events with frequency that increases with time (class C3), and all remaining events (class C2). Detected with ηc ¼ 20.0, GW150914 is the strongest event of the entire search. Consistent with its coalescence signal signature, it is found in the search class C3 of events with increasing time-frequency evolution. Measured on a background equivalent to over 67 400 years of data and including a trials factor of 3 to account for the search classes, its false alarm rate is lower than 1 in 22 500 years. This corresponds to a probability < 2 × 10−6 of observing one or more noise events as strong as GW150914 during the analysis time, equivalent to 4.6σ. The left panel of Fig. 4 shows the C3 class results and background. The selection criteria that define the search class C3 reduce the background by introducing a constraint on the signal morphology. In order to illustrate the significance of GW150914 against a background of events with arbitrary shapes, we also show the results of a search that uses the same set of events as the one described above but without this constraint. Specifically, we use only two search classes: the C1 class and the union of C2 and C3 classes (C2 þ C3). In this two-class search the GW150914 event is found in the C2 þ C3 class. The left panel of Fig. 4 shows the C2 þ C3 class results and background. In the background of this class there are four events with ηc ≥ 32.1, yielding a false alarm rate for GW150914 of 1 in 8 400 years. This corresponds to a false alarm probability of 5 × 10−6 equivalent to 4.4σ.  FIG. 4. Search results from the generic transient search (left) and the binary coalescence search (right). These histograms show the number of candidate events (orange markers) and the mean number of background events (black lines) in the search class where GW150914 was found as a function of the search detection statistic and with a bin width of 0.2. The scales on the top give the significance of an event in Gaussian standard deviations based on the corresponding noise background. The significance of GW150914 is greater than 5.1σ and 4.6σ for the binary coalescence and the generic transient searches, respectively. Left: Along with the primary search (C3) we also show the results (blue markers) and background (green curve) for an alternative search that treats events independently of their frequency evolution (C2 þ C3). The classes C2 and C3 are defined in the text. Right: The tail in the black-line background of the binary coalescence search is due to random coincidences of GW150914 in one detector with noise in the other detector. (This type of event is practically absent in the generic transient search background because they do not pass the time-frequency consistency requirements used in that search.) The purple curve is the background excluding those coincidences, which is used to assess the significance of the second strongest event. For robustness and validation, we also use other generic transient search algorithms [41]. A different search [73] and a parameter estimation follow-up [74] detected GW150914 with consistent significance and signal parameters. B. Binary coalescence search This search targets gravitational-wave emission from binary systems with individual masses from 1 to 99M⊙ , total mass less than 100M ⊙ , and dimensionless spins up to 0.99 [44]. To model systems with total mass larger than 4M ⊙ , we use the effective-one-body formalism [75], which combines results from the post-Newtonian approach [11,76] with results from black hole perturbation theory and numerical relativity. The waveform model [77,78] assumes that the spins of the merging objects are aligned with the orbital angular momentum, but the resulting templates can, nonetheless, effectively recover systems with misaligned spins in the parameter region of GW150914 [44]. Approximately 250 000 template waveforms are used to cover this parameter space. The search calculates the matched-filter signal-to-noise ratio ρðtÞ for each template in each detector and identifies maxima of ρðtÞ with respect to the time of arrival of the signal [79–81]. For each maximum we calculate a chi-squared statistic χ 2r to test whether the data in several different frequency bands are consistent with the matching template [82]. Values of χ 2r near unity indicate that the signal is consistent with a coalescence. If χ 2r is greater than unity, ρðtÞ is reweighted as ρ̂ ¼ ρ=f½1 þ ðχ 2r Þ3 =2g1=6 [83,84]. The final step enforces coincidence between detectors by selecting event pairs that occur within a 15-ms window and come from the same template. The 15-ms window is determined by the 10-ms intersite propagation time plus 5 ms for uncertainty in arrival time of weak signals. We rank coincident events based on the quadrature sum ρ̂c of the ρ̂ from both detectors [45]. To produce background data for this search the SNR maxima of one detector are time shifted and a new set of coincident events is computed. Repeating this procedure ∼107 times produces a noise background analysis time equivalent to 608 000 years. To account for the search background noise varying across the target signal space, candidate and background events are divided into three search classes based on template length. The right panel of Fig. 4 shows the background for the search class of GW150914. The GW150914 detectionstatistic value of ρ̂c ¼ 23.6 is larger than any background event, so only an upper bound can be placed on its false alarm rate. Across the three search classes this bound is 1 in 203 000 years. This translates to a false alarm probability < 2 × 10−7 , corresponding to 5.1σ. A second, independent matched-filter analysis that uses a different method for estimating the significance of its events [85,86], also detected GW150914 with identical signal parameters and consistent significance.

We report median values with 90% credible intervals that include statistical errors, and systematic errors from averaging the results of different waveform models. Masses are given in the source frame; to convert to the detector frame multiply by (1 þ z) [90]. The source redshift assumes standard cosmology [91]. Primary black hole mass Secondary black hole mass Final black hole mass Final black hole spin Luminosity distance Source redshift z When an event is confidently identified as a real gravitational-wave signal, as for GW150914, the background used to determine the significance of other events is reestimated without the contribution of this event. This is the background distribution shown as a purple line in the right panel of Fig. 4. Based on this, the second most significant event has a false alarm rate of 1 per 2.3 years and corresponding Poissonian false alarm probability of 0.02. Waveform analysis of this event indicates that if it is astrophysical in origin it is also a binary black hole merger [44]. VI. SOURCE DISCUSSION The matched-filter search is optimized for detecting signals, but it provides only approximate estimates of the source parameters. To refine them we use general relativity-based models [77,78,87,88], some of which include spin precession, and for each model perform a coherent Bayesian analysis to derive posterior distributions of the source parameters [89]. The initial and final masses, final spin, distance, and redshift of the source are shown in Table I. The spin of the primary black hole is constrained to be < 0.7 (90% credible interval) indicating it is not maximally spinning, while the spin of the secondary is only weakly constrained. These source parameters are discussed in detail in [39]. The parameter uncertainties include statistical errors and systematic errors from averaging the results of different waveform models. Using the fits to numerical simulations of binary black hole mergers in [92,93], we provide estimates of the mass and spin of the final black hole, the total energy radiated in gravitational waves, and the peak gravitational-wave luminosity [39]. The estimated total energy radiated in 2 gravitational waves is 3.0þ0.5 −0.5 M ⊙ c . The system reached a peak gravitational-wave luminosity of  equivalent to Several analyses have been performed to determine whether or not GW150914 is consistent with a binary black hole system in general relativity [94]. A first consistency check involves the mass and spin of the final black hole. In general relativity, the end product of a black hole binary coalescence is a Kerr black hole, which is fully described by its mass and spin. For quasicircular inspirals, these are predicted uniquely by Einstein’s equations as a function of the masses and spins of the two progenitor black holes. Using fitting formulas calibrated to numerical relativity simulations [92], we verified that the remnant mass and spin deduced from the early stage of the coalescence and those inferred independently from the late stage are consistent with each other, with no evidence for disagreement from general relativity. Within the post-Newtonian formalism, the phase of the gravitational waveform during the inspiral can be expressed as a power series in f 1=3 . The coefficients of this expansion can be computed in general relativity. Thus, we can test for consistency with general relativity [95,96] by allowing the coefficients to deviate from the nominal values, and seeing if the resulting waveform is consistent with the data. In this second check [94] we place constraints on these deviations, finding no evidence for violations of general relativity. Finally, assuming a modified dispersion relation for gravitational waves [97], our observations constrain the Compton wavelength of the graviton to be λg > 1013 km, which could be interpreted as a bound on the graviton mass mg < 1.2 × 10−22 eV=c2 . This improves on Solar System and binary pulsar bounds [98,99] by factors of a few and a thousand, respectively, but does not improve on the modeldependent bounds derived from the dynamics of Galaxy clusters [100] and weak lensing observations [101]. In summary, all three tests are consistent with the predictions of general relativity in the strong-field regime of gravity. GW150914 demonstrates the existence of stellar-mass black holes more massive than ≃25M⊙ , and establishes that binary black holes can form in nature and merge within a Hubble time. Binary black holes have been predicted to form both in isolated binaries [102–104] and in dense environments by dynamical interactions [105–107]. The formation of such massive black holes from stellar evolution requires weak massive-star winds, which are possible in stellar environments with metallicity lower than ≃1=2 the solar value [108,109]. Further astrophysical implications of this binary black hole discovery are discussed in [110]. These observational results constrain the rate of stellarmass binary black hole mergers in the local universe. Using several different models of the underlying binary black hole mass distribution, we obtain rate estimates ranging from 2–400 Gpc−3 yr−1 in the comoving frame [111–113]. This is consistent with a broad range of rate predictions as reviewed in [114], with only the lowest event rates being excluded. Binary black hole systems at larger distances contribute to a stochastic background of gravitational waves from the superposition of unresolved systems. Predictions for such a  background are presented in [115]. If the signal from such a population were detected, it would provide information about the evolution of such binary systems over the history of the universe. VII. OUTLOOK Further details about these results and associated data releases are available at [116]. Analysis results for the entire first observational period will be reported in future publications. Efforts are under way to enhance significantly the global gravitational-wave detector network [117]. These include further commissioning of the Advanced LIGO detectors to reach design sensitivity, which will allow detection of binaries like GW150914 with 3 times higher SNR. Additionally, Advanced Virgo, KAGRA, and a possible third LIGO detector in India [118] will extend the network and significantly improve the position reconstruction and parameter estimation of sources. VIII. CONCLUSION The LIGO detectors have observed gravitational waves from the merger of two stellar-mass black holes. The detected waveform matches the predictions of general relativity for the inspiral and merger of a pair of black holes and the ringdown of the resulting single black hole. These observations demonstrate the existence of binary stellar-mass black hole systems. This is the first direct detection of gravitational waves and the first observation of a binary black hole merger. 	On September 14, 2015 at 09:50:45 UTC the two detectors of the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory simultaneously observed a transient gravitational-wave signal. The signal sweeps upwards in frequency from 35 to 250 Hz with a peak gravitational-wave strain of 1.0 × 10−21. It matches the waveform predicted by general relativity for the inspiral and merger of a pair of black holes and the ringdown of the resulting single black hole. The signal was observed with a matched-filter signal-to-noise ratio of 24 and a false alarm rate estimated to be less than 1 event per 203 000 years, equivalent to a significance greater than 5.1σ. The source lies at a luminosity distance of 410þ160 −180 Mpc corresponding to a redshift z ¼ 0.09þ0.03 −0.04 . In the source frame, the initial black hole masses are 36þ5 −4M⊙ and 29þ4 −4M⊙, and the final black hole mass is 62þ4 −4M⊙, with 3.0þ0.5 −0.5M⊙c2 radiated in gravitational waves. All uncertainties define 90% credible intervals. These observations demonstrate the existence of binary stellar-mass black hole systems. This is the first direct detection of gravitational waves and the first observation of a binary black hole merger	B. P. Abbott et al.* (LIGO Scientific Collaboration and Virgo Collaboration)

Schwarzschild (Communicated January 13th, 1916 [see above p. 42].) translation and foreword by S. Antoci∗ and A. Loinger∗∗ Foreword. This fundamental memoir contains the ORIGINAL form of the solution of Schwarzschild’s problem. It is regular in the whole space-time, with the only exception of the origin of the spatial co-ordinates; consequently, it leaves no room for the science fiction of the black holes. (In the centuries of the decline of the Roman Empire people said: “Graecum est, non legitur”...).  §1. In his work on the motion of the perihelion of Mercury (see Sitzungsberichte of November 18th, 1915) Mr. Einstein has posed the following problem: Let a point move according to the prescription: where the gµν stand for functions of the variables x, and in the variation the variables x must be kept fixed at the beginning and at the end of the path of integration. In short, the point shall move along a geodesic line in the manifold characterised by the line element ds. The execution of the variation yields the equations of motion of the point: and the gαβ stand for the normalised minors associated to gαβ in the determinant |gµν |. According to Einstein’s theory, this is the motion of a massless point in the gravitational field of a mass at the point x1 = x2 = x3 = 0, if the “components of the gravitational field” Γ fulfil everywhere, with the exception of the point x1 = x2 = x3 = 0, the “field equations”  and if also the “equation of the determinant” is satisfied. The field equations together with the equation of the determinant have the fundamental property that they preserve their form under the substitution of other arbitrary variables in lieu of x1 , x2 , x3 , x4 , as long as the determinant of the substitution is equal to 1. Let x1 , x2 , x3 stand for rectangular co-ordinates, x4 for the time; furthermore, the mass at the origin shall not change with time, and the motion at infinity shall be rectilinear and uniform. Then, according to Mr. Einstein’s list, loc. cit. p. 833, the following conditions must be fulfilled too: 1. All the components are independent of the time x4 . 2. The equations gρ4 = g4ρ = 0 hold exactly for ρ = 1, 2, 3. 3. The solution is spatially symmetric with respect to the origin of the co-ordinate system in the sense that one finds again the same solution when x1 , x2 , x3 are subjected to an orthogonal transformation (rotation). 4. The gµν vanish at infinity, with the exception of the following four limits different from zero:  The problem is to find out a line element with coefficients such that the field equations, the equation of the determinant and these four requirements are satisfied. §2. Mr. Einstein showed that this problem, in first approximation, leads to Newton’s law and that the second approximation correctly reproduces the known anomaly in the motion of the perihelion of Mercury. The following calculation yields the exact solution of the problem. It is always pleasant to avail of exact solutions of simple form. More importantly, the calculation proves also the uniqueness of the solution, about which Mr. Einstein’s treatment still left doubt, and which could have been proved only with great difficulty, in the way shown below, through such an approximation method. The following lines therefore let Mr. Einstein’s result shine with increased clearness. §3. If one calls t the time, x, y, z, the rectangular co-ordinates, the most general line element that satisfies the conditions 1-3 is clearly the following:  The condition (4) requires: for  When one goes over to polar co-ordinates according to x = r sin ϑ cos φ, y = r sin ϑ sin φ, z =  Now the volume element in polar co-ordinates is equal to r 2 sin ϑdrdϑdφ, the functional determinant r 2 sin ϑ of the old with respect to the new coordinates is different from 1; then the field equations  would not remain in unaltered form if one would calculate with these polar co-ordinates, and one would have to perform a cumbersome transformation. However there is an easy trick to circumvent this difficulty. One puts: Then we have for the volume element: r 2 dr sin ϑdϑdφ = dx1 dx2 dx3 . The new variables are then polar co-ordinates with the determinant 1. They have the evident advantages of polar co-ordinates for the treatment of the problem, and at the same time, when one includes also t = x4 , the field equations and the determinant equation remain in unaltered form. In the new polar co-ordinates the line element reads: we write: The equation of the determinant: The field equations. Continuity of the f , except for x1 = 0.  §4. In order to formulate the field equations one must first form the components of the gravitational field corresponding to the line element (9). This happens in the simplest way when one builds the differential equations of the geodesic line by direct execution of the variation, and reads out the components from these. The differential equations of the geodesic line for the line element (9) result from the variation immediately in the form: The comparison with (2) gives the components of the gravitational field:  (the other ones are zero). Due to the rotational symmetry around the origin it is sufficient to write the field equations only for the equator (x2 = 0); therefore, since they will be differentiated only once, in the previous expressions it is possible to set everywhere since the beginning 1 − x22 equal 1. The calculation of the field equations then gives Besides these three equations the functions f1 , f2 , f3 must fulfil also the equation of the determinant For now I neglect (b) and determine the three functions f1 , f2 , f4 from (a), (c), and (d). (c) can be transposed into the form This can be directly integrated and gives  (α integration constant)  The addition of (a) and (c’) gives   By integrating once more, f2 = λ(3x1 + ρ)2/3 . (λ integration constant) The condition at infinity requires: λ = 1. Then f2 = (3x1 + ρ)2/3 .  (10)  Hence it results further from (c”) and (d)  By integrating while taking into account the condition at infinity Hence from (d) f1 =  As can be easily verified, the equation (b) is automatically fulfilled by the expressions that we found for f1 and f2 . Therefore all the conditions are satisfied apart from the condition of continuity. f1 will be discontinuous when  In order that this discontinuity coincides with the origin, it must be Therefore the condition of continuity relates in this way the two integration constants ρ and α. The complete solution of our problem reads now: f1 = where the auxiliary quantity  has been introduced. When one introduces these values of the functions f in the expression (9) of the line element and goes back to the usual polar co-ordinates one gets the line element that forms the exact solution of Einstein’s problem: The latter contains only the constant α that depends on the value of the mass at the origin. §5. The uniqueness of the solution resulted spontaneously through the present calculation. From what follows we can see that it would have been difficult to ascertain the uniqueness from an approximation procedure in the manner of Mr. Einstein. Without the continuity condition it would have resulted:  When α and ρ are small, the series expansion up to quantities of second order gives: This expression, together with the corresponding expansions of f2 , f3 , f4 , satisfies up to the same accuracy all the conditions of the problem. Within this approximation the condition of continuity does not introduce anything new, since discontinuities occur spontaneously only in the origin. Then the two constants α and ρ appear to remain arbitrary, hence the problem would be physically undetermined. The exact solution teaches that in reality, by extending the approximations, the discontinuity does not occur at the origin, but at r = (α3 − ρ)1/3 , and that one must set just ρ = α3 for the discontinuity to go in the origin. With the approximation in powers of α and ρ one should survey very closely the law of the coefficients in order to recognise the necessity of this link between α and ρ. §6. Finally, one has still to derive the motion of a point in the gravitational field, the geodesic line corresponding to the line element (14). From the three facts, that the line element is homogeneous in the differentials and that its coefficients do not depend on t and on φ, with the variation we get immediately three intermediate integrals. If one also restricts himself to the motion in the equatorial plane (ϑ = 90o , dϑ = 0) these intermediate integrals read:  If one introduces the notations: c2 /h = B, (1 − h)/h = 2A, this is identical to Mr. Einstein’s equation (11), loc. cit. and gives the observed anomaly of the perihelion of Mercury. Actually Mr. Einstein’s approximation for the orbit goes into the exact solution when one substitutes for r the quantity  Since α/r is nearly equal to twice the square of the velocity of the planet (with the velocity of light as unit), for Mercury the parenthesis differs from 1 only for quantities of the order 10−12 . Therefore r is virtually identical to R and Mr. Einstein’s approximation is adequate to the strongest requirements of the practice. Finally, the exact form of the third Kepler’s law for circular orbits will be derived. Owing to (16) and (17), when one sets x = 1/R, for the angular velocity n = dφ/dt it holds n = cx2 (1 − αx). For circular orbits both dx/dφ and d2 x/dφ2 must vanish. Due to (18) this gives:  The elimination of h from these two equations yields   The deviation of this formula from the third Kepler’s law is totally negligible down to the surface of the Sun. For an ideal mass point, however, it follows that the angular velocity does not, as with Newton’s law, grow without limit when the radius of the orbit gets smaller and smaller, but it approaches a determined limit (For a point with the solar mass the limit frequency will be around 104 per second). This circumstance could be of interest, if analogous laws would rule the molecular forces.	Foreword. This fundamental memoir contains the ORIGINAL form of the solution of Schwarzschild’s problem.

10	Paper8_1	1975	Particle Creation by Black Holes	Commun. math. Phys. 43, 199—220 (1975)  by Springer-Verlag 1975  Particle Creation by Black Holes S. W. Hawking Department of Applied Mathematics and Theoretical Physics, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, England Received April 12, 1975 Abstract. In the classical theory black holes can only absorb and not emit particles. However it is shown that quantum mechanical effects cause black holes to create and emit particles as if they were hot bodies with temperature  where K is the surface gravity of the black hole. This thermal emission leads to a slow decrease in the mass of the black hole and to its eventual disappearance: any primordial black hole of mass less than about 1015 g would have evaporated by now. Although these quantum effects violate the classical law that the area of the event horizon of a black hole cannot decrease, there remains a Generalized Second Law: S+^A never decreases where S is the entropy of matter outside black holes and A is the sum of the surface areas of the event horizons. This shows that gravitational collapse converts the baryons and leptons in the collapsing body into entropy. It is tempting to speculate that this might be the reason why the Universe contains so much entropy per baryon.  1.Although there has been a lot of work in the last fifteen years (see [1, 2] for recent reviews), I think it would be fair to say that we do not yet have a fully satisfactory and consistent quantum theory of gravity. At the moment classical General Relativity still provides the most successful description of gravity. In classical General Relativity one has a classical metric which obeys the Einstein equations, the right hand side of which is supposed to be the energy momentum tensor of the classical matter fields. However, although it may be reasonable to ignore quantum gravitational effects on the grounds that these are likely to be small, we know that quantum mechanics plays a vital role in the behaviour of the matter fields. One therefore has the problem of defining a consistent scheme in which the space-time metric is treated classically but is coupled to the matter fields which are treated quantum mechanically. Presumably such a scheme would be only an approximation to a deeper theory (still to be found) in which spacetime itself was quantized. However one would hope that it would be a very good approximation for most purposes except near space-time singularities. The approximation I shall use in this paper is that the matter fields, such as scalar, electro-magnetic, or neutrino fields, obey the usual wave equations with the Minkowski metric replaced by a classical space-time metric gab. This metric satisfies the Einstein equations where the source on the right hand side is taken to be the expectation value of some suitably defined energy momentum operator for the matter fields. In this theory of quantum mechanics in curved space-time there is a problem in interpreting the field operators in terms of annihilation and creation operators. In flat space-time the standard procedure is to decompose  200  S. W. Hawking  the field into positive and negative frequency components. For example, if φ is a massless Hermitian scalar field obeying the equation φ.abηab = ^ one expresses φ as where the {/J are a complete orthonormal family of complex valued solutions of the wave equation fι.abηab = ^ which contain only positive frequencies with respect to the usual Minkowski time coordinate. The operators α t and αj are interpreted as the annihilation and creation operators respectively for particles in the zth state. The vacuum state |0> is defined to be the state from which one cannot annihilate any particles, i.e.  In curved space-time one can also consider a Hermitian scalar field operator φ which obeys the co variant wave equation φ.abgab = 0. However one cannot decompose into its positive and negative frequency parts as positive and negative frequencies have no invariant_meaning in curved space-time. One could still require that the {/)} and the {/J together formed a complete basis for solutions of the wave equations with where S is a suitable surface. However condition (1.2) does not uniquely fix the subspace of the space of all solutions which is spanned by the {/)} and therefore does not determine the splitting of the operator φ into annihilation and creation parts. In a region of space-time which was flat or asymptotically flat, the appropriate criterion for choosing the {/•} is that they should contain only positive frequencies with respect to the Minkowski time coordinate. However if one has a space-time which contains an initial flat region (1) followed by a region of curvature (2) then a final flat region (3), the basis {fu} which contains only positive frequencies on region (1) will not be the same as the basis {/3l } which contains only positive frequencies on region (3). This means that the initial vacuum state lOj), the state which satisfies α l ί |0 1 ) = 0 for each initial annihilation operator α l ί 9 will not be the same as the final vacuum state |03> i.e. α 3 ί |0 1 >φO. One can interpret this as implying that the time dependent metric or gravitational field has caused the creation of a certain number of particles of the scalar field. Although it is obvious what the subspace spanned by the {/)} is for an asymptotically flat region, it is not uniquely defined for a general point of a curved spacetime. Consider an observer with velocity vector υa at a point p. Let B be the least upper bound \Rabcd\ in any orthonormal tetrad whose timelike vector coincides with iΛ In a neighbourhood U of p the observer can set up a local inertial coordinate system (such as normal coordinates) with coordinate radius of the order of B~*. He can then choose a family {/)} which satisfy equation (1.2) and which in the neighbourhood U are approximately positive frequency with respect to the time coordinate in U. For modes fi whose characteristic frequency ω is high compared to B^, this leaves an indeterminacy between fi and its complex conjugate fa of the order of the exponential of some multiple of — ωB~*. The indeterminacy between the annihilation operator at and the creation operator a] for the  Particle Creation by Black Holes  mode is thus exponentially small. However, the ambiguity between the ai and the a\ is virtually complete for modes for which ω < B*. This ambiguity introduces an uncertainty of ±i in the number operator a\ai for the mode. The density of modes per unit volume in the frequency interval ω to ω + dω is of the order of ω2dω for ω greater than the rest mass m of the field in question. Thus the uncertainty in the local energy density caused by the ambiguity in defining modes of wavelength longer than the local radius of curvature B~^, is of order B2 in units in which G = c — h = i. Because the ambiguity is exponentially small for wavelengths short compared to the radius of curvature B~^, the total uncertainty in the local energy density is of order B2. This uncertainty can be thought of as corresponding to the local energy density of particles created by the gravitational field. The uncertainty in the curvature produced via the Einstein equations by this uncertainty in the energy density is small compared to the total curvature of space-time provided that B is small compared to one, i.e. the radius of curvature B~^ is large compared to the Planck length 10~ 33 cm. One would therefore expect that the scheme of treating the matter fields quantum mechanically on a classical curved space-time background would be a good approximation, except in regions where the curvature was comparable to the Planck value of 1066 cm" 2 . From the classical singularity theorems [3-6], one would expect such high curvatures to occur in collapsing stars and, in the past, at the beginning of the present expansion phase of the universe. In the former case, one would expect the regions of high curvature to be hidden from us by an event horizon [7]. Thus, as far as we are concerned, the classical geometry-quantum matter treatment should be valid apart from the first 10~43 s of the universe. The view is sometimes expressed that this treatment will break down when the radius of curvature is comparable to the Compton wavelength ~10~ 1 3 cm of an elementary particle such as a proton. However the Compton wavelength of a zero rest mass particle such as a photon or a neutrino is infinite, but we do not have any problem in dealing with electromagnetic or neutrino radiation in curved space-time. All that happens when the radius of curvature of space-time is smaller than the Compton wavelength of a given species of particle is that one gets an indeterminacy in the particle number or, in other words, particle creation. However, as was shown above, the energy density of the created particles is small locally compared to the curvature which created them. Even though the effects of particle creation may be negligible locally, I shall show in this paper that they can add up to have a significant influence on black holes over the lifetime of the universe ~10 1 7 s or 1060 units of Planck time. It seems that the gravitational field of a black hole will create particles and emit them to infinity at just the rate that one would expect if the black hole were an ordinary body with a temperature in geometric units of ;c/2π, where K is the "surface gravity" of the black hole [8]. In ordinary units this temperature is of the order of lO^M" 1 °K, where M is the mass, in grams of the black hole. For 33 a black hole of solar mass (10 g) this temperature is much lower than the 3 °K temperature of the cosmic microwave background. Thus black holes of this size would be absorbing radiation faster than they emitted it and would be increasing in mass. However, in addition to black holes formed by stellar collapse, there might also be much smaller black holes which were formed by density fluctua-  tions in the early universe [9, 10]. These small black holes, being at a higher temperature, would radiate more than they absorbed. They would therefore presumably decrease in mass. As they got smaller, they would get hotter and so would radiate faster. As the temperature rose, it would exceed the rest mass of particles such as the electron and the muon and the black hole would begin to emit them also. When the temperature got up to about 1012 °K or when the mass got down to about 1014 g the number of different species of particles being emitted might be so great [11] that the black hole radiated away all its remaining rest mass on a strong interaction time scale of the order of 10"23 s. This would produce an explosion with an energy of 1035 ergs. Even if the number of species of particle emitted did not increase very much, the black hole would radiate away all its mass in the order of 10"28M3 s. In the last tenth of a second the energy released would be of the order of 1030 ergs. As the mass of the black hole decreased, the area of the event horizon would have to go down, thus violating the law that, classically, the area cannot decrease [7, 12]. This violation must, presumably, be caused by a flux of negative energy across the event horizon which balances the positive energy flux emitted to infinity. One might picture this negative energy flux in the following way. Just outside the event horizon there will be virtual pairs of particles, one with negative energy and one with positive energy. The negative particle is in a region which is classically forbidden but it can tunnel through the event horizon to the region inside the black hole where the Killing vector which represents time translations is spacelike. In this region the particle can exist as a real particle with a timelike momentum vector even though its energy relative to infinity as measured by the time translation Killing vector is negative. The other particle of the pair, having a positive energy, can escape to infinity where it constitutes a part of the thermal emission described above. The probability of the negative energy particle tunnelling through the horizon is governed by the surface gravity K since this quantity measures the gradient of the magnitude of the Killing vector or, in other words, how fast the Killing vector is becoming spacelike. Instead of thinking of negative energy particles tunnelling through the horizon in the positive sense of time one could regard them as positive energy particles crossing the horizon on pastdirected world-lines and then being scattered on to future-directed world-lines by the gravitational field. It should be emphasized that these pictures of the mechanism responsible for the thermal emission and area decrease are heuristic only and should not be taken too literally. It should not be thought unreasonable that a black hole, which is an excited state of the gravitational field, should decay quantum mechanically and that, because of quantum fluctuation of the metric, energy should be able to tunnel out of the potential well of a black hole. This particle creation is directly analogous to that caused by a deep potential well in flat space-time [18]. The real justification of the thermal emission is the mathematical derivation given in Section (2) for the case of an uncharged non-rotating black hole. The effects of angular momentum and charge are considered in Section (3). In Section (4) it is shown that any renormalization of the energymomentum tensor with suitable properties must give a negative energy flow down the black hole and consequent decrease in the area of the event horizon. This negative energy flow is non-observable locally.  Particle Creation by Black Holes  The decrease in area of the event horizon is caused by a violation of the weak energy condition [5—7, 12] which arises from the indeterminacy of particle number and energy density in a curved space-time. However, as was shown above, this indeterminacy is small, being of the order of B2 where B is the magnitude of the curvature tensor. Thus it can have a diverging effection a null surface like the event horizon which has very small convergence or divergence but it can not untrap a strongly converging trapped surface until B becomes of the order of one. Therefore one would not expect the negative energy density to cause a breakdown of the classical singularity theorems until the radius of curvature of space-time became 10"33 cm. Perhaps the strongest reason for believing that black holes can create and emit particles at a steady rate is that the predicted rate is just that of the thermal emission of a body with the temperature κ/2π. There are independent, thermodynamic, grounds for regarding some multiple of the surface gravity as having a close relation to temperature. There is an obvious analogy with the second law of thermodynamics in the law that, classically, the area of the event horizon can never decrease and that when two black holes collide and merge together, the area of the final event horizon is greater than the sum of the areas of the two original horizons [7, 12]. There is also an analogy to the first law of thermodynamics in the result that two neighbouring black hole equilibrium states are related by [8]  where M, Ω, and J are respectively the mass, angular velocity and angular momentum of the black hole and A is the area of the event horizon. Comparing this to  one sees that if some multiple of A is regarded as being analogous to entropy, then some multiple of K is analogous to temperature. The surface gravity is also analogous to temperature in that it is constant over the event horizon in equilibrium. Beckenstein [19] suggested that A and K were not merely analogous to entropy and temperature respectively but that, in some sense, they actually were the entropy and temperature of the black hole. Although the ordinary second law of thermodynamics is transcended in that entropy can be lost down black holes, the flow of entropy across the event horizon would always cause some increase in the area of the horizon. Beckenstein therefore suggested [20] a Generalized Second Law: Entropy 4- some multiple (unspecified) oϊA never decreases. However he did not suggest that a black hole could emit particles as well as absorb them. Without such emission the Generalized Second Law would be violated by for example, a black hole immersed in black body radiation at a lower temperature than that of the black hole. On the other hand, if one accepts that black holes do emit particles at a steady rate, the identification oϊκ/2π with temperature and \A with entropy is established and a Generalized Second Law confirmed.  2. Gravitational Collapse It is now generally believed that, according to classical theory, a gravitational collapse will produce a black hole which will settle down rapidly to a stationary axisymmetric equilibrium state characterized by its mass, angular momentum and electric charge [7, 13]. The Kerr-Newman solution represent one such family of black hole equilibrium states and it seems unlikely that there are any others. It has therefore become a common practice to ignore the collapse phase and to represent a black hole simply by one of these solutions. Because these solutions are stationary there will not be any mixing of positive and negative frequencies and so one would not expect to obtain any particle creation. However there is a classical phenomenon called superradiance [14-17] in which waves incident in certain modes on a rotating or charged black hole are scattered with increased amplitude [see Section (3)]. On a particle description this amplification must correspond to an increase in the number of particles and therefore to stimulated emission of particles. One would therefore expect on general grounds that there would also be a steady rate of spontaneous emission in these superradiant modes which would tend to carry away the angular momentum or charge of the black hole [16]. To understand how the particle creation can arise from mixing of positive and negative frequencies, it is essential to consider not only the quasistationary final state of the black hole but also the time-dependent formation phase. One would hope that, in the spirit of the "no hair" theorems, the rate of emission would not depend on details of the collapse process except through the mass, angular momentum and charge of the resulting black hole. I shall show that this is indeed the case but that, in addition to the emission in the superradiant modes, there is a steady rate of emission in all modes at the rate one would expect if the black hole were an ordinary body with temperature τc/2π. I shall consider first of all the simplest case of a non-rotating uncharged black hole. The final stationary state for such a black hole is represented by the Schwarzschild solution with metric  As is now well known, the apparent singularities at r = 2M are fictitious, arising merely from a bad choice of coordinates. The global structure of the analytically extended Schwarzschild solution can be described in a simple manner by a Penrose diagram of the r-t plane (Fig. 1) [6, 13]. In this diagram null geodesies in the r-t plane are at +45° to the vertical. Each point of the diagram represents a 2-sphere of area 4πr2. A conformal transformation has been applied to bring infinity to a finite distance: infinity is represented by the two diagonal lines (really null surfaces) labelled J?+ and «/", and the points / + , /", and 7°. The two horizontal lines r = 0 are curvature singularities and the two diagonal lines r = 2M (really null surfaces) are the future and past event horizons which divide the solution up ihto regions from which one cannot escape to J^+ and </". On the left of the diagram there is another infinity and asymptotically flat region. Most of the Penrose diagram is not in fact relevant to a black hole formed by gravitational collapse since the metric is that of the Schwarzchild solution  Particle Creation by Black Holes r =0 singularity   surface of -"collapsed body  region not applicable t o ' a gravitational collapse Fig. 2. Only the region of the Schwarzschild solution outside the collapsing body is relevant for a black hole formed by gravitational collapse. Inside the body the solution is completely different singularity  origin of coordinates  collapsing body Fig. 3. The Penrose diagram of a spherically symmetric collapsing body producing a black hole. The vertical dotted line on the left represents the non-singular centre of the body  only in the region outside the collapsing matter and only in the asymptotic future. In the case of exactly spherical collapse, which I shall consider for simplicity, the metric is exactly the Schwarzchild metric everywhere outside the surface of the collapsing object which is represented by a timelike geodesic in the Penrose diagram (Fig. 2). Inside the object the metric is completely different, the past event horizon, the past r = 0 singularity and the other asymptotically flat region do not exist and are replaced by a time-like curve representing the origin of polar coordinates. The appropriate Penrose diagram is shown in Fig. 3 where the conformal freedom has been used to make the origin of polar coordinates into a vertical line. In this space-time consider (again for simplicity) a massless Hermitian scalar field operator φ obeying the wave equation  The solutions {/•} of the wave equation fi;abgab = Q can be chosen so that on past null infinity J>~ they form a complete family satisfying the orthonormality conditions (1.2) where the surface S is «/" and so that they contain only positive frequencies with respect to the canonical affine parameter on J>~ . (This last condition of positive frequency can be uniquely defined despite the existence of "supertranslations" in the Bondi-Metzner-Sachs asymptotic symmetry group [21, 22].) The operators a{ and a\ have the natural interpretation as the annihilation and creation operators for ingoing particles i.e. for particles at past null infinity J~ . Because massless fields are completely determined by their data on «/", the operator φ can be expressed in the form (2.3) everywhere. In the region outside the event horizon one can also determine massless fields by their data on the event horizon and on future null infinity J?+. Thus one can also express φ  With the positive frequency condition on {pt}, the operators {bt} and [ b ] } can be interpreted as the annihilation and creation operators for outgoing particles, i.e. for particles on,/ + . It is not clear whether one should impose some positive frequency condition on the [q^ and if so with respect to what. The choice of the {qt} does not affect the calculation of the emission of particles to </+. I shall return to the question in Section (4). Because massless fields are completely determined by their data on J>~ one can express {pt} and {qt} as linear combinations of the {/•} and {/)}:   However, because the coefficients βtj will not be zero in general, the initial vacuum state will not appear to be a vacuum state to an observer at ,/+. Instead he will find that the expectation value of the number operator for the ί th outgoing mode is  Thus in order to determine the number of particles created by the gravitational field and emitted to infinity one simply has to calculate the coefficients β^. One would expect this calculation to be very messy and to depend on the detailed nature of the gravitational collapse. However, as I shall show, one can derive an asymptotic form for the βy which depends only on the surface gravity of the resulting black hole. There will be a certain finite amount of particle creation which depends on the details of the collapse. These particles will disperse and at late retarded times on J>+ there will be a steady flux of particles determined by the asymptotic form of β^. In order to calculate this asymptotic form it is more convenient to decompose the ingoing and outgoing solutions of the wave equation into their Fourier components with respect to advanced or retarded time and use the continuum normalization. The finite normalization solutions can then be recovered by adding Fourier components to form wave packets. Because the space-time is spherically symmetric, one can also decompose the incoming and outgoing solutions into spherical harmonics. Thus, in the region outside the collapsing body, one can write the incoming and outgoing solutions as   Fig. 4. The solution pω of the wave equation has an infinite number of cycles near the event horizon and near the surface v = vn  where it will be partly scattered and partly reflected through the centre, eventually emerging to J~. It is this part p™ which produces the interesting effects. Because the retarded time coordinate u goes to infinity on the event horizon, the surfaces of constant phase of the solution pω will pile up near the event horizon (Fig. 4). To an observer on the collapsing body the wave would seem to have a very large blue-shift. Because its effective frequency was very high, the wave would propagate by geometric optics through the centre of the body and out on </". On ^~P(ω} would have an infinite number of cycles just before the advanced time v=v0 where v0 is the latest time that a null geodesic could leave </", pass through the centre of the body and escape to J^+ before being trapped by the event horizon. One can estimate the form of p(^} on J~ near v = v0 in the following way. Let x be a point on the event horizon outside the matter and let la be a null vector tangent to the horizon. Let na be the future-directed null vector at x which is directed radially inwards and normalized so that lana — — 1. The vector — ma (ε small and positive) will connect the point x on the event horizon with a nearby null surface of constant retarded time u and therefore with a surface of constant  phase of the solution p ^\ If the vectors l and n are parallelly transported along a the null geodesic y through x which generates the horizon, the vector — &n will ( always connect the event horizon with the same surface of constant phase of p ^\  To see what the relation between ε and the phase of p ^ is, imagine in Fig. 2 that the collapsing body did not exist but one analytically continued the empty space Schwarzchild solution back to cover the whole Penrose diagram. One could then fl a transport the pair (/ , n ) back along to the point where future and past event horizons intersected. The vector — εna would then lie along the past event horizon. Let λ be the affine parameter along the past event horizon which is such that at  the point of intersection of the two horizons, λ = 0 and—— = n . The affine pardλ   (logε — logC) of the solution p%\ This result will also hold in the real spaceK time (including the collapsing body) in the region outside the body. Near the event horizon the solution p(^ will obey the geometric optics approximation as it passes through the body because its effective frequency will be very high. This means that if one extends the null geodesic γ back past the end-point of the event horizon and out onto J~ at v=v0 and parallelly transports na along y, the vector — εna will still connect y to a surface of constant phase of the solution p(£\ On J>~na will be parallel to the Killing vector Ka which is tangent to the null geodesic generators of </" :  Thus on J>~ p(ω] will be zero for v>v0 and for V<VQ  where P~ = Pω(2M) is the value of the radial function for Pω on the past event horizon in the analytically continued Schwarzchild solution. The expression (2.18) for p(*} is valid only for v0 — v small and positive. At earlier advanced times the amplitude will be different and the frequency measured with respect to v, will approach the original frequency ω. By Fourier transforming p™ one can evaluate its contributions to αωω> and βωω>. For large values of ω' these will be determined by the asymptotic form  One can evaluate this as follows. Consider the wave-packet pjn propagating backwards from J^+. A fraction l — Γjn of the wave-packet will be scattered by the static Schwarzchild field and a fraction Γjn will enter the collapsing body.  where αj^/ and β(2nω"> are calculated using (2.19, 2.20) from the part pff of the wave-packet which enters the star. The minus sign in front of the second term on the right of (2.27) occurs because the negative frequency components of pfj make a negative contribution to the flux into the collapsing body. By (2.21)  But for wave-packets at late retarded times, the fraction Γjn which enters the collapsing body is almost the same as the fraction of the wave-packet that would have crossed the past event horizon had the collapsing body not been there but the exterior Schwarzchild solution had been analytically continued. Thus this factor Γjn is also the same as the fraction of a similar wave-packet coming from «/" which would have crossed the future event horizon and have been absorbed by the black hole. The relation between emission and absorption cross-section is therefore exactly that for a body with a temperature, in geometric units, of κ/2π. Similar results hold for the electromagnetic and linearised gravitational fields. The fields produced on */" by positive frequency waves from ,/+ have the same asymptotic form as (2.18) but with an extra blue shift factor in the amplitude. This extra factor cancels out in the definition of the scalar product so that the asymptotic forms of the coefficients α and β are the same as in the Eqs. (2.19) and (2.20). Thus one would expect the black hole also to radiate photons and gravitons thermally. For massless fermions such as neutrinos one again gets similar results except that the negative frequency components given by the coefficients β now make a positive contribution to the probability flux into the collapsing body. This means that the term \β\2 in (2.27) now has the opposite sign. From this it follows that the number of particles emitted in any outgoing wave packet mode is (exp(2πωκ:" 1 )+l)~ 1 times the fraction of that wave packet that would have been absorbed by the black hole had it been incident from «/". This is again exactly what one would expect for thermal emission of particles obeying FermiDirac statistics. Fields of non-zero rest mass do not reach J>~ and J>+. One therefore has to describe ingoing and outgoing states for these fields in terms of some concept such as the project!ve infinity of Eardley and Sachs [23] and Schmidt [24]. However, if the initial and final states are asymptotically Schwarzchild or Kerr solutions, one can describe the ingoing and outgoing states in a simple manner by separation of variables and one can define positive frequencies with respect to the time translation Killing vectors of these initial and final asymptotic space-times. In the asymptotic future there will be no bound states: any particle will either fall through the event horizon or escape to infinity. Thus the unbound outgoing states and the event horizon states together form a complete basis for solutions of the wave equation in the region outside the event horizon. In the asymptotic past there could be bound states if the body that collapses had had a bounded radius for an infinite time. However one could equally well assume that the body had collapsed from an infinite radius in which case there would be no bound states. The possible existence of bound states in the past does not affect the rate of particle emission in the asymptotic future which will again be that of a body with temperature κ/2π. The only difference from the zero rest mass case is that the fre1 1 quency ω in the thermal factor (exp(2πω/c" )+l)~ now includes the rest mass energy of the particle. Thus there will not be much emission of particles of rest mass m unless the temperature κ/2π is greater than m.  One can show .that these results on thermal emission do not depend on spherical symmetry. Consider an asymmetric collapse which produced a black hole which settled to a non-rotating uncharged Schwarzchild solution (angular momentum and charge will be considered in the next section). The fact that the final state is asymptotically quasi-stationary means that there is a preferred Bondi coordinate system [25] on </+ with respect to which one can decompose the Cauchy data for the outgoing states into positive frequencies and spherical harmonics. On J~ there may or may not be a preferred coordinate system but if there is not one can pick an arbitrary Bondi coordinate system and decompose the Cauchy data for the ingoing states in a similar manner. Now consider one of the ,/+ states pωlm propagating backwards through this space-time into the collapsing body and out again onto «/". Take a null geodesic generator γ of the event horizon and extend it backwards beyond its past end-point to intersect </" at a point y on a null geodesic generator λ of J^~. Choose a pair of null vectors (la, ήa) at y with la tangent to y and ήa tangent to λ. Parallelly propagate /α, na along y to a point x in the region of space-time where the metric is almost that of the final Schwarzchild solution. At x ήa will be some linear combination of /" and the radial inward directed null vector na. This means that the vector — εήa will connect x to a surface of phase —ω/κ (logε — logE) of the solution pωlm where E is some constant. As before, by the geometric optics approximation, the vector — ma at y will connect y to a surface of phase — ω/κ (logε — logE) of p(^m where p^m is the part of pωlm which enters the collapsing body. Thus on the null geodesic generator λ of«/", the phase of p$m will be  where υ is an affine parameter on λ with value υ0 at y and H is a constant. By the geometrical optics approximation, the value of p$m on λ will be	Abstract. In the classical theory black holes can only absorb and not emit particles. However it is shown that quantum mechanical effects cause black holes to create and emit particles as if they were hot bodies with temperature ;^10~6  —— °K where K is the surface gravity of the black 2πk \ M , hole. This thermal emission leads to a slow decrease in the mass of the black hole and to its eventual disappearance: any primordial black hole of mass less than about 1015  g would have evaporated by now. Although these quantum effects violate the classical law that the area of the event horizon of a black hole cannot decrease, there remains a Generalized Second Law: S+^A never decreases where S is the entropy of matter outside black holes and A is the sum of the surface areas of the event horizons. This shows that gravitational collapse converts the baryons and leptons in the collapsing body into entropy. It is tempting to speculate that this might be the reason why the Universe contains so much entropy per baryon.

On each null geodesic generator of <#~p(ωϊm w^ have the form (2.31) with different values of L, VQ, and H. The lack' of spherical symmetry during the collapse will cause Pωίm on </" to contain components of spherical harmonics with indices (/', m'}  Because of (2.31), the coefficients α and β will have the same ω' dependence as in (2.19) and (2.20). Thus one still has the same relation as (2.21):  As before, for each (/, m), one can make up wave packets pjnlm. The number of particles emitted in such a wave packet mode is   Again, Γjnlm is equal to the fraction of a similar wave packet coming from J>~ that would have been absorbed by the black hole. Thus, using (2.33), one finds that the emission is just that of a body of temperature κ/2π: the emission at late retarded times depends only on the final quasi-stationary state of the black hole and not on the details of the gravitational collapse. 3. Angular Momentum and Charge If the collapsing body was rotating or electrically charged, the resulting black hole would settle down to a stationary state which was described, not by the Schwarzchild solution, but by a charged Kerr solution characterised by the mass M, the angular momentum J, and the charge Q. As these solutions are stationary and axisymmetric, one can separate solutions of the wave equations in them into a factor eιωu or eιωv times e~ιmφ times a function of r and θ. In the case of the scalar wave equation one can separate this last expression into a function of r times a function of θ [26]. One can also completely separate any wave equation in the non-rotating charged case and Teukolsky [27] has obtained completely separable wave equations for neutrino, electromagnetic and linearised gravitational fields in the uncharged rotating case. Consider a wave packet of a classical field of charge e with frequency ω and axial quantum number m incident from infinity on a Kerr black hole. The change in mass dM of the black hole caused by the partial absorption of the wave packet  where Ω and Φ are the angular frequency and electrostatic potential respectively of the black hole [13]. The fluxes of energy, angular momentum and charge in the wave packet will be in the ratio ω:m:e. Thus the changes in the mass, angular momentum and charge of the black hole will also be in this ratio. Therefore  A wave packet of a classical Boson field will obey the weak energy condition: the local energy density for any observer is non-negative. It follows from this [7, 12] that the change in area dA induced by the wave-packet will be non-negative. Thus if  the change in mass dM of the black hole must be negative. In other words, the black hole will lose energy to the wave packet which will therefore be scattered with the same frequency but increased amplitude. This is the phenomenon known as "superradiance".  For classical fields of half-integer spin, detailed calculations [28] show that there is no superradiance. The reason for this is that the scalar product for halfinteger spin fields is positive definite unlike that for integer spins. This means that the probability flux across the event horizon is positive and therefore, by conservation of probability, the probability flux in the scattered wave packet must be less than that in the incident wave packet. The reason that the above argument based on the first law breaks down is that the energy-momentum tensor for a classical half-integer spin field does not obey the weak energy condition. On a quantum, particle level one can understand the absence of superradiance for fermion fields as a consequence of the fact that the Exclusion Principle does not allow more than one particle in each outgoing wave packet mode and therefore does not allow the scattered wave-packet to be stronger than the incident wavepacket. Passing now to the quantum theory, consider first the case of an unchanged, rotating black hole. One can as before pick an arbitrary Bondi coordinate frame on </" and decompose the operator φ in terms of a family {/ωίm} of incoming solutions where the indices ω, /, and m refer to the advanced time and angular dependence o f / on J>~ in the given coordinate system. On J^+ the final quasistationary state of the black hole defines a preferred Bondi coordinate system using which one can define a family {pωιm} of outgoing solutions. The index / in this case labels the spheroidal harmonics in terms of which the wave equation is separable. One proceeds as before to calculate the asymptotic form of p$m on e/~. The only difference is that because the horizon is rotating with angular velocity Ω with respect to </+, the effective frequency near a generator of the event horizon is not ω but ω — mΩ. This means that the number of particles emitted in the wave-packet mode pjnlm is {exp(2πκ-\ω-mΩ}} + 1}~ l Γ j n l m .  (3.4)  The effect of this is to cause the rate of emission of particles with positive angular momentum m to be higher than that of particles with the same frequency ω and quantum number / but with negative angular momentum — m. Thus the particle emission tends to carry away the angular momentum. For Boson fields, the factor in curly brackets in (3.4) is negative for ω<mΩ. However the fraction Γjnlm of the wave-packet that would have been absorbed by the black hole is also negative in this case because ω<mΩ is the condition for superradiance. In the limit that the temperature κ/2π is very low, the only particle emission occurs is an amount +Γjnlm in the modes for which ω<mΩ. This amount of particle creation is equal to that calculated by Starobinski [16] and Unruh [29], who considered only the final stationary Kerr solution and ignored the gravitational collapse. One can treat a charged non-rotating black hole in a rather similar way. The behaviour of fields like the electromagnetic or gravitational fields which do not carry an electric charge will be the same as before except that the charge on the black will reduce the surface gravity fe and hence the temperature of the black hole. Consider now the simple case of a massless charged scalar field φ which obeys the minimally coupled wave equation  Particle Creation by Black Holes  The phase of a solution pω of the wave equation (3.5) is not gauge-invariant but the propagation vector ika=Va(logpω) — ieAa is. In the geometric optics or WKB limit the vector ka is null and propagates according to  An infinitessimal vector z will connect points with a "guage invariant" phase difference of ίkaza. If zα is propagated along the integral curves of fc" according to   z will connect surfaces of constant guage invariant phase difference. In the final stationary region one can choose a guage such that the electromagnetic potential Aa is stationary and vanishes on J+. In this guage the field equation (3.5) is separable and has solutions pω with retarded time dependence eιωu. Let x be a point on the event horizon in the final stationary region and let la and na be a pair of null vectors at x. As before, the vector — εna will connect the event horizon with the surface of actual phase —ω/κ (logε—logC) of the solution pω. However the guage invariant phase will be — κ~ 1(ω— eΦ)(logε — logC) where Φ = KaAa is the electrostatic potential on the horizon and Ka is the timetranslation Killing vector. Now propagate la like k1 in Eq. (3.6) back until it intersects a generator λ of </" at a point y and propagate na like za in Eq. (3.7) along the integral curve of la. With this propagation law, the vector — εna will connect surfaces of constant guage invariant phase. Near «/" one can use a different electromagnetic guage such that Aa is zero on J>~. In this guage the phase of p(ω} along each generator of J~~ will have the form  where H is a constant along each generator. This phase dependence gives the same thermal emission as before but with ω replaced by ω — eΦ. Similar remarks apply about charge loss and superradiance. In the case that the black hole is both rotating and charged one can simply combine the above results.  4. The Back-Reaction on the Metric I now come to the difficult problem of the back-reaction of the particle creation on the metric and the consequent slow decrease of the mass of the black hole. At first sight it might seem that since all the time dependence of the metric in Fig. 4 is in the collapsing phase, all the particle creation must take place in the collapsing body just before the formation of the event horizon, and that an infinite number of created particles would hover just outside the event horizon, escaping to ,/+ at a steady rate. This does not seem reasonable because it would involve the collapsing body knowing just when it was about to fall through the event horizon whereas the position of the event horizon is determined by the whole future history of the black hole and may be someway outside the apparent horizon, which is the only thing that can be determined locally [7]. Consider an observer falling through the horizon at some time after the collapse. He can set up a local inertial coordinate patch of radius ~M centred on the point where he crosses the horizon. He can pick a complete family {hω} of solutions of the wave equations which obey the condition:   (where S is a Cauchy surface) and which have the approximate coordinate dependence eiωt in the coordinate patch. This last condition determines the splitting into positive and negative frequencies and hence the annihilation and creation operators fairly well for modes hω with ω>M but not for those with ω<M. Because the {hω}9 unlike the {pω}, are continuous across the event horizon, they will also be continuous on «/". It is the discontinuity in the {pω} on J~ at V = VQ which is responsible for creating an infinite total number of particles in each mode. pω by producing an (α/)"1 tail in the Fourier transforms of the {pω} at large negative frequencies ω. On the other hand, the {hω} for ω>M will have very small negative frequency components on */". This means that the observer at the event horizon will see few particles with ω > M. He will not be able to detect particles with ω<M because they will have a wavelength bigger than his particle detector which must be smaller than M. As described in the introduction, there will be an indeterminacy in the energy density of order M~ 4 corresponding to the indeterminacy in the particle number for these modes. The above discussion shows that the particle creation is really a global process and is not localised in the collapse: an observer falling through the event horizon would not see an infinite number of particles coming out from the collapsing body. Because it is a non-local process, it is probably not reasonable to expect to be able to form a local energy-momentum tensor to describe the back-reaction of the particle creation on the metric. Rather, the negative energy density needed to account for the decrease in the area of the horizon, should be thought of as arising from the indeterminacy of order of M" 4 of the local energy density at the horizon. Equivalently, one can think of the area decrease as resulting from the fact that quantum fluctuations of the metric will cause the position and the very concept of the event horizon to be somewhat indeterminate. Although it is probably not meaningful to talk about the local energy-momentum of the created particles, one may still be able to define the total energy flux over a suitably large surface. The problem is rather analogous to that of defining gravitational energy in classical general relativity: there are a number of different energy-momentum pseudo-tensors, none of which have any invariant local significance, but which all agree when integrated over a sufficiently large surface. In the particle case there are similarly a number of different expressions one can use for the renormalised energy-momentum tensor. The energy-momentum tensor for a classical field φ is  If one takes this expression over into the quantum theory and regards the φ's as operators one obtains a divergent result because there is a creation operator for each mode to the right of an annihilation operator. One therefore has to subtract out the divergence in some way. Various methods have been proposed for this (e.g. [30]) but they all seem a bit ad hoc. However, on the analogy of the pseudotensor, one would hope that the different renormalisations would all give the  Particle Creation by Black Holes  same integrated fluxes. This is indeed the case in the final quasi-stationary region: all renormalised energy-momentum operators Tab which obey the conservation equations 7^ = 0, which are stationary i.e. which have zero Lie derivative with respect to the time translation Killing vector Ka and which agree near </+ will give the same fluxes of energy and angular momentum over any surface of constant r outside the event horizon. It is therefore sufficient to evaluate the energy flux near ^+: by the conservation equations this will be equal to the energy flux out from the event horizon. Near </+ the obvious way to renormalise the energymomentum operator is to normal order the expression (4.2) with respect to positive and negative frequencies defined by the time-translation Killing vector Ka of the final quasi-stationary state. Near the event horizon normal ordering with respect to Ka cannot be the correct way to renormalise the energy-momentum operator since the normal-ordered operator diverges at the horizon. However it still gives the same energy outflow across any surface of constant r. A renormalised operator which was regular at the horizon would have to violate the weak energy condition by having negative energy density. This negative energy density is not observable locally. In order to evaluate the normal ordered operator one wants to choose the {gj which describe waves crossing the event horizon, to be positive frequency with respect to the time parameter defined by Ka along the generators of the horizon in the final quasi-stationary state. The condition on the {qt} in the timedependent collapse phase is not determined but this should not affect wave packets on the horizon at late times. If one makes up wave-packets {qjn} like the [pjn}> one finds that a fraction Γjn penetrates through the potential barrier around the black hole and gets out to J>~ with the same frequency ω that it had on the horizon. This produces a δ(ω-ω') behaviour in γjnω,. The remaining fraction l — Γjn of the wave-packet is reflected back by the potential barrier and passes through the collapsing body and out onto J~. Here it will have a similar form to pff. Thus for large ω',  By a similar argument to that used in Section (2) one would conclude that the number of particles crossing the event horizon in a wave-packet mode peaked at late times would be  For a given frequency ω, i.e. a given value of j, the absorption fraction Γjn goes to zero as the angular quantum number / increases because of the centrifugal barrier. Thus at first sight it might seem that each wave-packet mode of high / value would contain  particles and that the total rate of particles and energy crossing the event horizon would be infinite. This calculation would, of course, be inconsistent with the result obtained above that an observer crossing the event horizon would see only 4 a finite small energy density of order M~ . The reason for this discrepancy seems  S. W. Hawking  of the wave equation only in the region outside the event horizon and not actually on the event horizon itself. In order to calculate the particle flux over the horizon one therefore has to calculate the flux over some surface just outside the horizon and take the limit as the surface approaches the horizon. To perform this calculation it is convenient to define new wave-packets x jn = pff + <ffi which represent the part of pjn and qjn which passes through the collapsing body and yjn = pff + q(V which represents the part of pjn and qjn which propagates out to «/" through the quasi-stationary metric of the final black hole. In the initial vacuum state the {yjn} modes will not contain any particles but each xjn mode will contain {Qxp(2πωκ~1)— I}" 1 particles. These particles will appear to leave the collapsing body just outside the event horizon and will propagate radially outwards. A fraction Γjn will penetrate through the potential barrier peaked at r=3M and will escape to J>+ where they will constitute the thermal emission of the black hole. The remaining fraction 1-Γ^ will be reflected back by the potential barrier and will cross the event horizon. Thus the net particle flux across a surface of constant r just outside the horizon will be Γjn directed outwards. I shall now show that using the normal ordered energy momentum operator, the average energy flux across a surface of constant r between retarded times ul and u2  is directed outwards and is equal to the energy flux for the thermal emission from a hot body. Because the {yjn} contain no negative frequencies on «/", they will not make any contribution to the expectation value (4.5) of the normal ordered energy-momentum operator. Let   where ω and ω" are the frequencies of the wave-packets pjn and pyn» respectively. In the limit u2 — u1 tends to infinity, the second term in the integrand in (4.8) will integrate out and the first term will contribute only for (j",ri') = (j,n). By arguments similar to those used in Section 2,  where Γω= limΓ^ is the fraction of wave-packet of frequency that would be absorbed by the black hole. The energy flux (4.10) corresponds exactly to the rate of thermal emission calculated in Section 2. Any renormalised energy momentum  Particle Creation by Black Holes  singularity Collapsing body  Fig. 5. The Penrose diagram for a gravitational collapse followed by the slow evaporation and eventual disappearance of the black hole, leaving empty space with no singularity at the origin  operator which agrees with the normal ordered operator near </ + , which obeys the conservation equations, and which is stationary in the final quasi-stationary region will give the same energy flux over any surface of constant r. Thus it will give positive energy flux out across the event horizon or, equivalently, a negative energy flux in across the event horizon. This negative energy flux will cause the area of the event horizon to decrease and so the black hole will not, in fact, be in a stationary state. However, as long as the mass of the black hole is large compared to the Planck mass 10"5 g, the rate of evolution of the black hole will be very slow compared to the characteristic time for light to cross the Schwarzchild radius. Thus it is a reasonable approximation to describe the black hole by a sequence of stationary solutions and to calculate the rate of particle emission in each solution. Eventually, when the mass of the black hole is reduced to 10~5 g, the quasi-stationary approximation will break down. At this point, one cannot continue to use the concept of a classical metric. However, the total mass or energy remaining in the system is very small. Thus, provided the black hole does not evolve into a negative mass naked singularity there is not much it can do except disappear altogether. The baryons or leptons that formed the original collapsing body cannot reappear because all their rest mass energy has been carried away by the thermal radiation. It is tempting to speculate that this might be the reason why the universe now contains so few baryons compared to photons: the universe might have started out with baryons only, and no radiation. Most of the baryons might have fallen into small black holes which then evaporated giving back the rest mass energy of baryons in the form of radiation, but not the baryons themselves. The Penrose diagram of a black hole which evaporates and leaves only empty space is shown in Fig. 5. The horizontal line marked "singularity" is really a region where the radius of curvature is of the order the Planck length. The matter that runs into this region might reemerge in another universe or it might even reemerge in our universe through the upper vertical line thus creating a naked singularity of negative mass.

INTRODUCTIO¹ GRAVITATION THE ONLY FORCE IN WHICH NEUTRINOS ARE SUBJECT TO SIMPLE ANALYSIS  NOWLEDGK of neutrinos to date is confined mainly to emission and absorption processes; that is, to the domain of elementary particle transformations. For comparison, imagine that one knew about electrons only the rate at which they are produced in beta decay, or absorbed in E-electron absorption processes, but knew nothing about the motion of electrons in electric and magnetic 6elds, nothing about the binding of electrons in atoms or the existence of spin-orbit coupling and very little about the stress energy tensor of the electron. What can one do to learn some fraction as much about neutrinos as one knows today about electrons P The neutrino does not respond directly to electric or magnetic fields. Therefore, if one wishes to inQuence its orbit by forces subject to simple analysis one has to make use of gravitational fields. In other words, one has to consider the physics of a neutrino in a curved metric. For this task the only available tools of analysis are theoretical. We accept the recently clarified' and dramatically tested' ' neutrino theory. We see no motive to change the theory. Instead we recall in Sec. 2 the clearly defined extension of the Dirac equation to the curved space that represents the most general gravitational field. In Sec. 3, we specialize to the neutrino with its zero mass and to the class of solutions with right-  handed polarization that are demanded by the recently gained knowledge. ' ' Section 4 separates out the radial wave equation for the motion of a neutrino in a centrally symmetric gravitational field, and identifies one term in this equation with a spin-orbit coupling. Section 5 compares and contrasts the energy level spectrum in the case of spherical symmetry for (1) an electron in an electrostatic Geld, (2) an electron in a gravitational field, (3) a photon in a gravitational field, and (4) a neutrino in a gravitational field. Section 6 recalls the statistical mechanics of an ensemble of neutrinos. Section 7 discusses some neutrino pair creation processes that do not depend upon beta interactions for their existence. Section 8 deals with the contribution of neutrinos to the stress energy tensor, Sec. 9 deals with the gravitational interaction of two neutrinos traveling parallel or antiparallel to each other; and Sec. 10 with the contribution to the stress energy tensor due to a neutrino in a bound orbit. Finally, Sec. 11 examines by way of illustration an object where both the creation of gravitational fields by neutrinos, and the response of neutrinos to gravitational fields come into play: a geon or entity constituted entirely of neutrinos and held together by their mutual gravitational attractions.  2. MATHEMATICS OF SPIN IN CURVED SPACE Spinor fields have been treated in general relativity by many authors4 and from three principal points of view (Table I). The three formalisms are in principle equivalent and must therefore in any actual problem give identical results for such well-defined quantities as 4See W. L. Bade and H. Jehle, Revs. Modern Phys. 25, 714 (1953) for a general review of the literature. To their list of principal references one should add M. Riesz, Lund Univ. Math. Sem. Band 12 (1954); F. J. Belinfante, Physica 7, 305 (1940).  of the three principal formalisms for description of spin in general relativity.

Bargmann because of its generality. The equations of this formalism are covariant with respect to general coordinate transformations, and invariant under general, i.e., position-dependent, similarity transformations of the spinors. The fundamental connection between space and spin is made through a 6eld of y matrices which satisfy the anticommutation relationship,   at each point in space, where g,, is the metric tensor at that point, and I is the unit matrix. For the sigeufgre of the metric tensor we adopt the familiar Pauli convention (1, 1, 1, —1). Let the dependence of the g, ~ upon position be known. Then one can set up a generally covariant spinor formalism with the help of any field of 4X4 matrices y; that have the following properties: (1) their components are continuous functions of posi-  tion in space time, (2) they satisfy (1) and (3) they transform like a vector under coordinate transformations, (4) under the spinor transformation (splllor)~e~  =S  (spmor)og)  they undergo the similarity transformation  It also substantially simplifies the treatment of charged spinor fields to limit attention to real representations, yI„of the spin matrices, and to limit attention to spinor transformations, 5, whose matrix elements are also real. The principal feature of the mathematical formalism is a definition of covariant differentiation which is the natural generalization of the covariant difI'erentiation of tensor analysis (Table II). In addition to the usual Christo8el symbols, I';~, formed from the metric, g;I„ it is necessary to introduce four 4X4 matrices I'~. These quantities are uniquely determined up to an  NEUTRINOS TABLE  II. Covariant  GRAVITATION AND  differentiation of spin dependent with covariant differentiation  Special form when space is Rat, coordinates are Euclidean, and y's are independent of position Additional quantities needed to define covariant derivative when one or more of these conditions are not  40 functions of position I', I,  The F;q and four matrices, I'I,  fulfilled  Formula to determine these additional quantities from the metric  How these quantities enter into the definition of the covariant derivative Depends upon the transformation properties of the quantity being differentiated  the symbol * means Hermitian adjoint (the transpose of the complex conjugate). The quantity, V'I, A, transforms like A under similarity transformations and like a tensor of one higher rank under coordinate transformations. where  Thus, at each point, x, in 4 space it is possible to transform from the general coordinates x' to a system xi ("Vierbein") whose metric is Minkowskian at that point:   The formalism which confines itself to solutions of (1) of the special type (7) is called Vierbein formalism. In terms of the Vierbein components b;&', a the explicit solution of (2) has the simple form'  where and ai is arbitrary. In the Vierbein frame a similarity transformation of the spinors is equivalent of the to a Lorentz transformation Vierbein. Thus the invariance of the formalism under can be understood geosimilarity transformations metrically as invariance und, er arbitrary Lorentz transformations of the Vierbein. These Lorentz transformations have nothing to do with any coordinate transformation, and vary arbitrarily from point to point in space. The Dirac equation in general relativity can be written in the form  = 1, and e" ' changes sign on permutation of where any two indices. From any solution of these equations in a metric of arbitrary curvature one can generate a new solution by a special kind of transformation that we may call an "e-rotation";  where o. is an angle that is independent time. In Rat space this transformation   not a rotation in any ordinary sense except in the special case where K and II represent the principal polarization directions of a monochromatic plane wave; then the n transformation rotates the axes of polarization by the angle o.. Similarly, let P be a solution of the Dirac equation for zero mass in a space-time continuum of arbitrary curvature. Then one can generate a new solution by the   whose covariant divergence vanishes by virtue of the Dirac equation (9). The Dirac equation. can be derived from the variational principle  by independent  In this special case of zero rest-mass, the wave equation and the Lagrangian are invariant under a wider class of transformations than are usually considered in the Dirac theory. The situation is analogous to the case of the charge-free electromagnetic field, Ii;y. Consider any solution of Maxwell's equations,  by means of a "Hermitizing matrix, e, chosen so that both n itself and the four matrices, nip, are Hermitian. In the Vierbein formalism we may choose the y~ to be real and choose' +=i''. One then can form a current density Here we assume the arbitrary traces of the F~ have been adjusted so as to account for the effects of the electromagnetic potentials. To form real expressions, as for example for the current density, we can follow Bargmann with minor differences in notation and define the "Pauli conjugate" of P,   In the special case where the neutrino wave is linearly polarized in a given region of space, the P rotation turns this direction of polarization through the angle P. That ps' is a solution of (13) follows from (3) and the anticommutation relations (18); hence the linear combination, (17), of P and yqP is also a solution. Xo change whatever in the metric can lift the deand generacy between the spin polarization states exp PP&5)P. An analogous situation occurs in the physics of a two electron system. No allowable system of forces can ever produce a difference in energy between the states u(xi, x2) and exp(iyP»)u(xi, x~), where Pi2 is the permutation operator. Nature apparently does not ever permit an irrevocable degeneracy of this kind. Only the combination u(xi, x2) — u(x2, xi) is allowed. Assume similarly that nature rules out a duplicity of spin states for the neutrino that could never be split by any gravita-  ALPHA AND BETA ROTATIONS AND TWOCOMPONENT NEUTRINO WAVE EQUATION  We set the mass term equal to zero in the Dirac equation (9) and the Lagrangian (12) to obtain the wave equation for a Dirac-type neutrino,  'The known possibility of this transformation in pat space is well  NEUTRAL AND tional field, however strong. More specifically, assume that the only allowed state, lP, for the neutrino is a state that is transformed into a multiple of itself by every P rotation:  Then one concludes that the allowed state functions necessarily have circular polarisatiozz, in the sense that the expression  constitutes a mixture with 90' phase diGerence of the states with rotations of 0' and 180'. To change the sign of i in (20) is only to interchange the definitions of positive and negative energy states. Lee and Yang' have recently given different arguments for considering all circular polarization. neutrinos to have right-handed Their considerations have received dramatic verification. ' ' The conclusion appears inescapably that neutrinos possess only one state of polarization, which is circular. The allowable spinor state functions satisfy the condition  and in a suitable representation have only two nonzero components. They can be described by Pauli's spinors of two components, as Lee and Yang show. They introduce the two-component wave equation  where e are the three 2)&2 Pauli spin matrices. To write this equation in generally covariant form, it is convenient to introduce four 2X2 matrices s; which consideration has an arbitrary curvature and topology' We assume for simplicity that time has the topology of a straight line. We are indebted to Professor V. Bargmann for informing us of a theorem cited by Hopf at Camthe International Congress of Mathematicians, to the effect that one can always in a three-dimensional space define three mutually orthogonal nonsingular vector fields a construction that is well known to be impossible on the Iso-dimensional closed surface of a sphere. Then one has only to take over the standard four real p matrices of Rat space and employ the Vierbein formalism to have four real matrices,  4. MOTION OF  A NEUTRINO IN A SPHERICALLY SYMMETRICAL GRAVITATION FIELD  We explore the reactIon of the neutrino to a gravitational field in the simplest known case: a spherically symmetric metric of the Schwarzschild type,   The correct interpretation of the s' and the covariant derivative V'; is well known from spinor analysis. A beta rotation is not the only means to generate a new solution of the neutrino wave equation (13) from a general solution, lP. Let a representation be employed in  and let the complex conjugate of (13) be taken; then satisfies the wave it follows at once that lP„pl, „„„;„g„, equation as well as does P itself. When @ represents a pOSitiVe energy State, 4'complex coajagace Of COurSe represents a negative energy state; but there is ordinarily no well-defined distinction between the two kinds of states in a metric which varies both with space and with time. How does one know that the basic matrices can still space under be taken real when the three-dimensional   Here the coordinates are The dilation functions X(r) and v(r) are assumed to depend upon distance in an arbitrary way; they are not limited to the special Schwarzschild solution for a localized concentration of mass,   In order to write the Dirac equation in this metric we choose a field of p matrices of the type (7). Two choices for these matrices are simple: (1) Vierbein axes parallel to the r, 0, and q axes at each point, so that the desired Dirac matrices, y' are expressed in terms of the standard Dirac matrices, p', for a Cartesian coordinate system; by the formulas rl  The two choices lead to the same radial equation, but to a diferent dependence of the components of the spinor wave function upon the angles (Table I). In case (2) the angular dependence agrees with that predicted in the familiar case of special relativity by  standard formulas. ' Such ambiguities in the wave function are to be expected whenever one uses a formalism which is invariant under similarity transformations that are quite independent of coordinate transformations. The physically meaningful quantities, such as the current density, will, of course, agree for both choices, for the similarity transformation leaves these quantities invariant. We show the explicit calculations for our choice 1. The 1"i are found from (2) or (8),  A. WHEELER   The Dirac equation for a particle of mass )iA/c takes the form   and commutes with h. We The can therefore choose simultaneous eigenfunctions of h and E, and separate the pth component of the wave function, co„, into radial, angular and time factors,  Here the quantity k represents (energy/hc). The angular factor, 0', is determined by the requirement  where k is constant. This equation for eigenstates of the angular motion has been investigated by Schrodinger. He finds, in agreement with the conventional treatment of the Dirac equation in a central field, a spectrum of positive and negative integral eigenvalues k. Only the two matrices p4 and p& remain explicitly in the radial equation (34) after the operator E is replaced by the number k. They can therefore be represented by 2/2 matrices, and the radial factor by a two-  S.

For the neutrino, of course, we annul both v and p.  IN FIELD In order to gain some qualitative understanding of the behavior of electrons and neutrinos in gravitational fields we first consider the case of an electron in a gravitational field. We take over the Schwarzschild solution (27) for the metric outside a mass M. We substitute this metric into the radial wave equation (39) and neglect terms of order 1/c' and higher.

The foregoing weak field analysis demands a binding energy for the particle small compared to its rest energy. It obviously will not apply to the neutrino with its zero rest mass. Moreover, bound orbits lie in the energy mc2 and will cease to exist region between +mc2 and — for an object with zero rest mass. The wave function for such an object never falls off exponentially in the region where the metric has become Qat. However, it is possible to construct a metri. c with an inner region, a barrier region, and an outer region, in such a way that the neutrino wave function falls off exponentially in the barrier region. Then leakage from the inner region to the outer region is greatly inhibited. Electively bound proper states of 1ong life then exist for the neutrino in the inner region. Such trapping of neutrinos is illustrated especially simply in the metric of the thin shell spherical geon, 		DieTeR R. BRiLL own JoHN A. WHeeLeR

However, this term appears with opposite sign in the second order wave equations for the two components, Ii and G, of the same state function. From the fact that the two diGerent equations have the same eigenvalues, it follows that the last /go coupling terms together in (45) and in (46) produce no net effect on the energy levels. Otherwise stated, the energy eigenvalues are completely invariant against the change from k to — k. This degeneracy is the same as the fundamental polarization degeneracy that was discussed in Sec. 4. The demand that. the neutrino have right-handed polarization means that the allowed state function is given neither by the solution of (45) and (46) for positive k, nor by the solution for negative k, but by the proper linear combination of these two solutions. However, (45) and (46) give the correct pieces out of which to construct the allowed total wave function, and also gives the correct energy eigenvalues. It is now appropriate to check that the same radial equations are obtained in the two component formalism. For spin matrices, s;, that satisfy the equations of definition (23), we make a choice analogous to the choice  The last term on the right-hand sides of the dimensionless effective potentials g(p) and rj(p) of (45) and (46) has the character of a spin-orbit coupling. As in the case of an electron moving under electrostatic forces, where the spin-orbit coupling is proportional to the angular momentum and to the radial derivative of the potential, so here one term in the e6ect, ive potential experienced by the neutrino is proportional to the  we rewrite the two first-order wave equations (39) for zero rest mass and zero electrostatic potential. We then eliminate one of the two dependent variables to obtain a single equation of the second order for the other variable; either   These representation-independent expressions evidently can also be generated from the I'I, 's, of the Dirac formalism (30) by a simple change: every product of the form p, p, is replaced by a product of the form s; j sz'. The Dirac equation for a particle of mass m in the present formalism operates on a pair of spinors, P and qo, each of two components,   are the Pauli spin matrices. Then the general relativity form of the Pauli-I. ee-Yang neutrino equation in a centrally symmetric metric becomes   We can no longer find an angular operator, E, that commutes with (55). Instead, we proceed as follows. (1) We temporarily introduce an explicit representation for the Pauli matrices, o,, and express (55) as two coupled first-order equations for two unknown functions. (2) We deduce the character of the solution from what we already know of the solution in the Dirac formalism. (3) Out of this solution we construct: the mixed density matrix, M(1,2)=tk(2)gt(1). From that matrix we can calculate the expectation value of any physical quantity. The neutrino Aux, for example, is given by the trace (neutrino flux) ~=/tish/  = Trois'M(1, 1)). (4) This density matrix can be expressed combination of the four matrices, a; and translated back to a form independent of of the Pauli matrices. It representation the form   where and g are the angular functions of Schrodinger. Such quantities as the number, Aux and stress and energy density of neutrinos follow in a straightforward way from the density matrix (57) according to the pattern of (56), based on two component spinors. Alterna, tively the same answers can be obtained from the Dirac formalism, with which we shall generally work. In either 2 or 4 component formalisms the energy levels of a trapped neutrino are found by solution of an eigenvalue equation which can be taken to be (45). We assume the geon metric (43). Then the dimensionless effective potential, $(p), has the form   outside the radius upon azi-  We consider a solution, ~, which depends muthal angle and time as where F and G are the radial functions already introduced. The angular factors in (57) have the form  This equation. is obtained in explicit form from (31) by annulling the mass term, titl and replacing y, everywhere by s;. Again introduce a new form for the wave function, This potential is sketched in Fig. 1 for several values of the positive integer, k. Semistable bound states occur only for values of k of the order of 10 and larger. For such values of k terms in k can be neglected, relative to terms in k'. Then in the outer region $(p) attains it:s maximum value  The dimensionless vibration frequency or energy, e, of the eth semistable bound state can be estimated from   where u and b are the classical turning points of the "bound" state of highest energy. The integral exists „l=k/3* only when e lies between P;„*=2k/27 and (the two dashed limits in the right-hand part of Fig. 1). The total number,  of bound states of type k can be estimated by setting e' equal to the maximum of ((p) and calculating (62), with the result   NEUTRINOS AND GRAVITATION For each value of k the spectrum of allowed values for the dimensionless energy parameter, e, stretches from  a minimum value a little above (proportional to k) to a maximum value a little less than t „~ (also proportional to k). In this interval the number of levels, 1V~, is also approximately proportional to k. These qualitative features of the level scheme are shown in Fig. 1. In the absence of a gravitational field the neutrino spectrum reduces to the natural analog of the spectrum of the free electron. For each wave number, (k„k„,k.), there is one state of right-handed circular polarization and of positive energy; and a second state of negative energy and left handed circular polarization. All states of negative energy are to be considered as filled. Absence of a neutrino from a negative energy is to be interpreted as the presence of an antineutrino. According to hole theory the momentum (or angular momentum) of the real physical antineutrino is the negative of the momentum (or angular momentum) of the missing negative energy neutrino. For that negative energy neutrino the momentum and spin angular momentum are opposite in direction, according to the equation, H= c(e p), of Lee and Yang. Therefore, as they show, the momentum and spin angular momentum have opposite directions for the real physical antineutrino.  AND THERMAL EQUILIBRIUM OF NEUTRINOS  ELECTRON IN' GRAVITATIONAL  6. STATISTICAL MECHANICS  Gamow and Schoenberg" have given reason to believe that neutrino emission determines the rate of gravitational contraction of a heavy star in late phases of evolution, after the normal sources of thermonuclear energy have been exhausted. In oversimpli6ed terms, hot neutrons change to cooler protons plus electrons plus neutrinos; hot protons and electrons change to cooler neutrons and antineutrinos. The medium continually loses energy by emission of neutrinos and antiGamow's "Urea process. The v's and f's neutrinos escape so much more readily than photons that they alone determine the rate of energy liberation and gravitational contraction. In late phases of such gravitational contraction the density mi. ght rise to a point where the opacity of matter even to neutrinos begins to make itself felt. For example, consider the point where nuclear densities have been reached, of the order of 10" nucleons/cm'; and assume a neutrino interception cross section, 10 cm', of the order of that found by Reines and crowan"; then the mean free path of a neutrino will be of the order of only 1 km. Under such conditions one has to speak of an opacity with respect to neutrinos and a local neutrino temperature along lines familiar from the theory of transfer of heat by electromagnetic radiation. One does not have to consider this particular problem of stellar interiors to raise the question: what   levels of an electron in an electrofield, and of a photon and a neutrino in a gravitational field. The left-hand diagram in these four cases gives, respectively, the electrostatic potential; the Einstein gravitational potential, — g44= e" for the "geon metric"; the dimensionless effective potential, g(p) =t(l+1)e"/p~ for photons; and the corresponding quantity for neutrinos Lthe g(p) of (59) The bound states of the electron lie lower than mc~ and are therefore stable against electron escape. The energy splitting at (a) arises from Lamb shift and any other perturbative effects that raise the effective potential near the origin compared to the ideal Coulomb potential. Similarly, a splitting arises at (c) because s-wave electrons respond more than p-wave electrons to the central fiat region of the metric. The splittings at (b) and (d) arise from spin-orbit coupling. Photons and neutrinos can be trapped only in states of greater or lesser life time, never in completely stable levels. The wave function of a trapped state falls off exponentially in the region of the effective potential barrier, lower left. Zero or small angular momentum corresponds to motion along, or nearly along, the radius vector a kind of motion that always leads to escape of the photon or neutrino. The diagrams lower right show schematically both the position and the width of the semistable bound states. Each photon state can be occupied by any number of photons of either independent state of polarization. Each neutrino state can be occupied by only one neutrino. The state has the same frequency and corresponding antineutrino energy and can also be occupied. There is nothing to compare with the spin-orbit splitting of the electron states: the angular momentum of the neutrino always precesses in such a way as to stay parallel to the neutrino momentum.  static field and in a gravitational is the equilibrium distribution of neutrinos' The specification of this equilibrium demands one more quantity for neutrinos than for photons: one has to give both the temperature and a suitably defined Fermi energy. The probability W(E) that a neutrino state of energy, E,   The quantities of greatest interest are the total density of neutrinos,  the total density of antineutrinos (given by the same expression with the sign of g reversed), and the total energy density,   The neutrino energy is smaller than the electromagnetic energy by the factor 8. The number of accessible states of a given wave number is the same for the two kinds of radiation: two spin polarizations for photons; and for the more penetrating radiation, one neutrino and one antineutrino state. Moreover, the occupation probability for either kind of state follows the same limiting Holtzmann formula for states of high energy W(E)~e E~r. But any given state of low energy can be occupied by many photons, and at most one neutrino: hence the advantage for electromagnetic energy compared to neutrino energy. These relationships are entirely changed when the Fermi energy of the neutrinos has a nonzero value. In that case the energy density of the neutrinos can be made to have any arbitrarily large value. O'.  T represents the temperature  content  (69)  CREATION OF NEUTRINO PAIRS  In this paper we disregard all processes for creation or disappearance of neutrinos which depend upon transformations of the elementary particles, considering only the response of neutrinos to the curvature of the metric. More specifically, we limit attention to processes in which according to hole theory a neutrino is raised from a negative energy state to a positive energy state, or where, in physical terms, a neutrino-antineutrino pair is created. Is there anything special about the gravitational field which makes it incapable of raising a neutrino from a negative energy state to a positive energy state? Otherwise stated, does there exist any quantity, Q, which will commute or anticommute with the operator in the wave equation (51) and which will serve to distinguish positive and negative energy states? To construct such an operator one has only the four independent 2&(2 spin matrices. Among these only the unit matrix commutes with (51). From it nothing of interest can be constructed. We therefore expect that there is no point of principle which prevents transitions from negative energy to positive energy states. In other words, it is as much out of the question in neutrino physics as it is in electron physics to make a well-defined distinction between negative and positive energy states when fields are or electromagnetic general gravitational at work. The mechanism of the transitions in the neutrino case is simple. Just as a static disturbance in the metric defiects a neutrino, bringing about a transition between states of different momenta, so a time-varying disturbance causes a transition between states of different  Number of times matrix elements occur in transition probability  Pair creation cross section for 100% creation probability Resulting estimate for cross section for pair creation  0  Asymptotic behavior of accurate formula for cross section, high energy, unpolarized radiation energies. Let such a time-varying disturbance in the free gravitational field be analyzed into Fourier components in the weak field approximation. According to the laws of conservation of momentum and energy, no single monochromatic disturbance will be able to produce transitions of neutrinos from negative energy states to positive energy states (apart from the singular case where all three momenta lie along the same line). Real pair production demands collaboration of at least two of these monochromatic disturbances, traveling in different directions. As in the case where two photons collide to produce an electron pair, so here it is simplest to analyze the two quantum process in a frame of reference in which the momenta are equal and opposite. For an order-of-magnitude estimate of the cross section for pair creation it is not necessary to evaluate matrix elements in detail. Instead, one can follow the reasoning sketched by Bohr and Rosenfeld in their discussion of vacuum polarization. Let the two concentrations of energy be pictured as localized in two regions of space, of dimensions ~X, and as moving towards each other with velocity c, so that they overlap and collaborate only during a time interval K/c. Then the calculation outlined in Table III leads to a cross section  for creation of a (v, v) pair by two gravitons, each of energy E. The cross section is fantastically small for quanta of any familiar energies. As the energy is increased, a domain of wavelengths is ultimately reached, 1.6X 10 (AG/c') cm, at which any normal analysis of gravitational disturbances into waves would appear to be ruled out: the disturbances in the metric have reached the order of magnitude, bg 1, where nonlinear effects completely dominate the analysis. Even at such incredibly high energies the estimated cross section (71) only attains a value of the order To estimate the cross section for this process even for neutrino energies, A~, small compared to the critical energy (Ac'/G) i, it is not legitimate to apply (do/dfI)  because the principal contribution to the integral comes from virtual processes at energies, Ace', comparable to and larger than the critical energy. We have not considered processes that belong in the realm of true elementary particle physics; processes such as  in the metric with the stress-momentum-energy tensor, T;&. This tensor has been given for example by Pauli" in the case of Rat space. Rosenfeld" has discussed this tensor in curved space from the viewpoint of the Uierbein formalism and derived some of its components. We follow his very general approach. The Lagrangian density in general relativity is proportional to the quantity   The calculated cross section rises well above threshold according to the asymptotic formula"    From the absorption process one infers via causality arguments the existence of the scattering process (77). Applied to this process, the dispersion integral (76) is divergent. Attribute to the dionly logarithmically vergent logarithm the conventional value "10. Then one estimates" a scattering cross section of the order   It appears reasonable to conclude that both (f, f) scattering processes are negligible at any reasonable energies in comparison with the two absorption processes. The two absorption cross sections have the same E' energy dependence, interestingly enough. Their ratio is the dimensionless number   a testimonial to the well-known great ratio between beta couplings and gravitational couplings. 8. DENSITY OF STRESS, MOMENTUM, AND ENERGY  So far we have considered the response of a neutrino (or electron) to a given metric, either static or varying in time. Now we ask for the response of the gravitational field to the neutrino (or electron). The Einstein 6eld equations connect the gravitational field and the change   as a consequence of the fieM equations. It is remarkable that this trace vanishes for the neutrino field (p=0) just as it does for the electromagnetic 6eld. One can use this result to derive the expressions already given for the density of neutrino energy under conditions of thermodynamic equilibrium.

INTERACTION BETWEEN TWO PENCILS ON NEUTRINOS We consider a momentum tensor. beam of neutrinos For simplicity, let varying spinor function of position constant in the domain of the pencil large compared to X=1/k and (2) and strongly outside of this region. The gradient of P contains terms that come from the gradient of N, and others from the gradient of the exponential; but the second terms are overwhelmingly more important than the erst ones. We conclude that all components of T;~ with ~ or k equal to 2 or 3 are negligible. The significant components have the value   where s" is the previously defined four vector of Qow and density.

The derivatives are removed by partial integration, and the various terms in the second part of the integrand collected to form the covariant derivative of the typical component of the second application of the energy We ask for the e6ect of a directed in an otherwise nearly Qat space. the beam move in the x direction. then the neutrino wave  since the Qow-density four vector is light-like. Tolman and Khrenfest have investigated" the metric due to a pencil like concentration of electromagnetic energy of identical character. Therefore the results which they derived for light also hold for neutrinos. Two photons or neutrinos, or one electron and one neutrino, attract when their propagation vectors are antiparallel with twice the Newtonian value, and not at all when their propagation vectors are parallel. Therefore the neutrinos in a toroidal neutrino geon will be in their most stable configuration when half go around one way and half go around the other way.  10. STRESS, MOMENTUM, AND ENERGY OF A NEUTRINO IN A TRAPPED STATE As a third application of the stress energy tensor we consider the motion of a neutrino in a nearly bound orbit in a central field, as in Sec. 5. Let the time dependence of the wave function be described by the factor iET/Ac), and neglect any small imaginary part exp( — of E that describes the slow leakage of the state out of the zone of trapping. Then the stress energy tensor takes the form  Require that P be an eigenstate of the s component of the total angular momentum. Then these expressions are independent of p. It is therefore a simple matter to sum or average them over various orientations of the orbit provided the contributions add incoherently. It is easy to give conditions which make this incoherent addition legitimate. The e6ect of the addition or averaging is to make (T,"), (Trr), (T/), and (T„&) the only nonzero components, and to eliminate the dependence upon angle. Then these surviving components of the averaged stress-momentum-energy tensor depend only upon the radial components of the neutrino wave function. When this wave function has the form (36), using the wave equation (32), these averages take   A. WHEELER  In the opposite extreme case where all the neutrinos go around the same way, then the right-handed character of the neutrinos implies that the resulting toroidal system is not mirror symmetric with respect to reflections in its own plane. It would be interesting to investigate the consequences of this asymmetry to see whether it shows up in the gravitational field near the toroidal geon. Among spherically symmetrical geons perhaps the simplest to consider is a thermal geon. A thermal neutrino geon divers from a thermal electromagnetic geon only in a trivial respect. The photon energy density in a thermal geon is  "For further discussion, especially of unexplored analogies between gravitation physics and hydrodynamics and the characteristic unit of mass as  11. NEUTRINO GEON So far as one knows, geons have nothing to do either with elementary particle physics or with astrophysics. They have interest for quite another reason. Gravitational fields have a nonlinear character that has many unexplored consequences. A few of these consequences come to light in the analysis of a geon. A collection of immaterial energy holds itself together by its own gravitational attraction. The analysis of such an object or "geon" combines both major topics of the present paper: the response of neutrinos to gravitational fields, and the production of gravitational fields by neutrinos. Geons of toroidal form appear in principle to be more stable than spherical geons, at least when comparable numbers of quanta go around in the two opposite directions. The case in which the angular momentum is zero has been analyzed by Krnst. 24  Then all the calculated graphs of reference 23 apply at once, and a complete description of the metric and energy distribution is available for a thermal neutrino geon. In the other simple limiting case of a spherical neutrino geon, all of the energy is concentrated in a thin spherical shell. In ray language, all of the neutrinos are executing circular orbits of the same radius. Orbits of all orientations occur with equal probability. It is a matter of choice that is, a matter of initial conditions whether neutrino orbits of many diferent energies are occupied, or only states of a single energy are filled. We take the second option to simplify the analysis, although it demands a higher energy per neutrino to provide a given total mass. The wavelength of the neutrinos is then very small compared to the geon radius so the quantum number, k, is very large. To formulate equations for the self-consistent metric, we proceed as in reference 12, introducing   From our analysis of some of the interactions between neutrinos and gravitational fields we conclude that neutrino physics has an interesting character in and by itself, even when attention is withdrawn from all betaThe behavior of neutrinos has ray transformations. become a little clearer, but the mystery why spinors occur in nature is left as pressing as ever. What is there about the description of the geometry of space which is not already adequately covered by ordinary scalars, vectors, and tensors of standard tensor analysis' To this question the mathematics of spinor fields gives a well known answer: spinors allow one to describe rotations at one point in space completely independently of rotations at all other points in space rotations that have nothing to do with the coordinate transformations that are treated in the usual tensor analysis. Fully to see at work this machinery of independent rotations at each point in space, we do best to consider the spinor field in a general curved space, as in this paper. But the deeper part of such rotations in the description of nature is still mysterious.  (108)  These equations for the self-consistent field of a thermal geon are very similar to (38), (40), and (41) of reference 12 for electromagnetic geons. When we neglect terms in k compared to terms in k', the two systems of equations become identical. The solution for the case of large angular momentum" leads to the geon metric.

Planck (Received January 7, 1901) In other form reported in the German Physical Society (Deutsche Physikalische Gesellschaft) in the meetings of October 19 and December 14, 1900, published in Verh. Dtsch. Phys. Ges. Berlin, 1900, 2, 202 and 237  Translated from German by Kuyanov Yu.V. [kuyanov@mx.ihep.su]  Preface The recent spectral measurements of O. Lummer and E. Pringsheim1 and even more striking those of H. Rubens and F. Kurlbaum2 , both confirming more recent results obtained by H. Beckmann3 , would discover that the law of the energy distribution in the normal spectrum first stated by W. Wien from the molecular-kinetic consideration and later by me from the theory of electromagnetic radiation is not universally correct. In any case an improvement on the theory is needed and I shall further try to carry through basing on the theory of electromagnetic radiation developed by me. First of all there is necessary for it to find an alterable link in the chain of reasons resulting in the Wien’s energy distribution law. So one handles to remove this link from the chain and create a suitable substitute. The fact that the physical ground of the electromagnetic radiation theory including the hypothesis of the“natural radiation”, resists destructive criticism, is shown in my recent work4 ; and since the calculations are known to be error free, so the statement remains to be held that the energy distribution law of the normal spectrum is totally defined if one succeeds in calculation of  entropy S of irradiated monochromatic vibrating resonator as a function of its vibrational energy. So then from the relation dS/dU = 1/ϑ one keeps the temperature ϑ dependence on energy U , and since the energy U , on the other hand, is simply related5 with a radiation density of appropriate number of vibrations, so the temperature dependence on this radiation density is also obtained. So the normal distribution of energy is one for which the radiation densities of any different numbers of vibrations have the same temperature. Thus the total problem is self reduced to that of definition S as a function of U , and the essential part of the following research is devoted to the solution of this problem. In the first my work on this problem I have entered S directly by defining with no further substantiation, as the simple function of U , and have limited by showing that such form for the entropy satisfies to all requirements of the thermodynamics. Then I considered that it is alone possible and therefore the Wien’s law, from it flowing out, necessarily is the universal one. In later, more particular research6 it seemed to me, however, that it should be expressions, doing the same, and that in any case therefore one more condition is needed for anyone being able to calculate S uniquely. It seemed to me that I have found one such condition in the form of statement, immediately then considered by me as plausible, that by the infinitesimal irreversible alteration of the near thermal equilibrium being system of N uniform, just in stationary radiation field placed resonators, the bound up with it alteration of the total entropy SN = N S depends only on their total energy UN = N U and their alteration but not on the energy U of particular resonators. This statement leads again with necessity to the Wien’s energy distribution law. But now however the later is not confirmed by experience, so the conclusion is forced that this statement in its universality also cannot be right and so from the theory is to be removed7 . Therefore yet another condition should be entered which enables the calculation of S, and for its realization the more detailed consideration of the entropy concept is needed. The direction of these deliberate thoughts is indicated by the consideration of the fragility of early made supposition. The path is below described, in which the new simple expression for entropy as well as the new formula for radiation are self found, both contradicting no fact established till now.  compares besides the criticism, to which this statement is exposed yet: W. Wien. Rapport für den Pariser Congress, 1900, 2, 40; O. Lummer. Loc. cit., p. 92.  I. The calculation of entropy of any resonator as a function of its energy §1 An entropy is conditioned by disorder, and this disorder in accordance with electro-magnetic theory of radiation is based on monochromatic vibrations of any resonator if although it remains in a stable stationary field of radiation, on non-regularity by which it permanently changes its amplitude and its phase, since one clocks time intervals which are long compared with a time of vibration, but short compared with a measurement time. If the amplitude and the phase both are absolutely constant as well as vibrations are quite homogeneous, no entropy could exist and the vibrational energy should be quite free convertible into the work. A constant energy U of alone stationary vibrating resonator is therefore as an average by time to be perceived or what turns to quite the same result, as a simultaneous average of energies of large number N of uniform resonators, just into stationary radiation field placed, sufficiently removed from one another to have no affect to each other directly. In this sense in future we will speak about an average energy U of a separate resonator. Then a total energy of such system of N resonators is corresponded to certain total entropy of the same system where an average entropy of any separate resonator is represented by S, and this entropy SN is based on a disorder with which the total energy UN is distributed among particular resonators.  §2 Now we suppose an entropy SN of a system with an arbitrary remaining additive constant to be proportional to logarithm of the probability W with which N resonators altogether possess an energy UN ; therefore:  In my opinion this supposition originates from the base of the definition of the probability W mentioned whereas in the premise, put on the ground of the electromagnetic theory of radiation, we have not any support, enabling to speak about such probability in a definite sense. For the expedience of so aimed supposition its simplicity as well as its neighbourhood with that of the kinetic theory of gases are standing for 8 .  Now it is worth reminding to find the probability W of N resonators alltogether having a vibrational energy UN . It is necessary for it to imagine UN not as a continuous unlimited divided value, but as a discrete one, composed of integer number of finite equal parts. If we give a name energy element ε to such part, so one can suppose that  where P is an integer, in general, large number, whereas the value for ε is till to be defined. Now it is clear that the distribution P of energy elements among N resonators can happen by some limited quite definite number of manners. We give a name “complexion” to every such manner of distribution following L. Boltzmann who had used this name for an expression with a similar idea. Having numbered resonators by 1, 2, 3, . . . , N , one writes them in a row each to another and under each resonator places a number of energy elements fallen to it in some arbitrary distribution, so for each complexion one obtains a symbol of the following form: Here N = 10, P = 100 are considered. The number < of all possible complexions is obviously equal to one of all possible digital images which can be obtained in this manner for the lower row with definite N and P . For intelligibility it should be mentioned that two complexions are considered as different if corresponding digital images have the same numbers but in a different order. Following combinatory, the number of all possible complexions is Here is in a first approximation according to Stirling offer:  therefore in appropriate approximation  The hypothesis, we now wish to put into the base of further calculation, is as follows: the probability of that N resonators altogether possess vibrational energy UN is proportional to the number < of all possible complexions with energy UN distributed among N resonators, or by other words: each certain complexion is as probable as either another one. It should in last line only by experience be proved whether this hypothesis virtually hit into nature. Instead however an opposite one should be possible: once an experience should judge in its favor, the validity of hypothesis will result in the further conclusions on the special nature of resonator’s vibrations, namely on the character of meanwhile appearing “indifferent and in their value compared primary game spaces” by expression manner of J. v. Kries9 . In a modern state of this question a further promotion of this idea should certainly appear as premature.  §5 According to hypothesis introduced in relation with the equation (3), the entropy of considered system of resonators with suitable definition of additive constant is: Joh. v. Kries. Die Principien der Wahrscheinlichkeitsrechnung. Freiburg, 1886, p. 36. and accepting (4) and (1): Therefore according to (2), entropy S of a resonator as a function of its energy U is: II. The deduction of the Wien’s displacement law  Following a Kirchhoff’s law of proportionality of both emission- and absorbability, discovered by W. Wien 10 and called by his name so-called the displacement law, including, as a particular case, the law of Stefan– Boltzmann of full emittance dependence on temperature, builds the most valuable constituent in the well grounded foundation of the theory of heat radiation. In a fashion, given by M. Thiesen 11 , it announces:  where λ is a wavelength, Edλ is a volume density of a spectral slice between λ and λ + dλ belonging to “black” radiation12 , ϑ is a temperature and ψ(x) is a known function of a single argument x.  §7 Now we are coming to investigate what Wien’s displacement law says about our resonator’s entropy S dependence on its energy and its own period, that is in those general case that resonator itself is in an arbitrary  One should perhaps more conveniently speak about “white” radiation, whose proper generalization is now understood as a “quite white light”. diathermal medium. For this aim first of all let us generalize the Thiesen’s form of the law on the radiation in an arbitrary diathermal medium with the velocity of light propagation c. Since we have to consider not a total radiation but monochromatic one, so when comparing different diathermal media, the number of vibrations ν should necessarily be introduced instead of wavelength λ. Thus the volume density of a spectral slice between ν and ν + dν, belonging to energy of radiation, is to be denoted as udν, so one should write: udν instead of Edν, c/ν instead of λ and cdν/ν 2 instead of dλ. This results in:  Now according to known Kirchhoff-Clausius’s law, the energy, emitted by black surface in a time unit into a diathermal medium, for defined temperature ϑ and defined number of vibrations ν is reverse proportional to the square of the velocity of propagation c2 ; thus the volume energy density u is reverse proportional to c3 , and we obtain:   where constants of the function f do not depend on c. Instead of it we could also write when f every time, as in following, means a new function of a single argument:  and by the way see that in a cube of a wavelength size a contained radiation energy with a certain temperature as well as a number of vibrations is known to be: uλ3 , the same for all diathermal media.  In order to pass from the volume density of radiation u to the energy U of the resonator being in the radiation field and stationary vibrating with the same number of vibrations ν, we shall use the relation, published in equation (34) of my work on non-reversible processes of radiation 13 :   (< is the intensity of monochromatic line-polarized beam), which together with the known equation  From here and (7) it follows:   where now c is not at all present. Instead of it we should also write:  Finally introducing yet more the entropy of resonator S, we assign: and integrating, one obtains:  i.e. the entropy of resonator, vibrating in an arbitrary diathermal medium, depends only on the single variable U/ν and besides keeps only the universal constants. This, as I know, is the simplest representation of the Wien’s displacement law.  Applying the Wien’s displacement law in its latter representation to the expression (6) for the entropy S, one can realize that the energy element ε should be proportional to the number of vibrations ν, so: ε=h·ν and therefore:  Here h and k are the universal constants. By substitution into (9) one obtains:  and the energy distribution law searched then follows from (8):  or also if one with in § 7 shown substitutions instead of the number of vibrations ν introduces again the wavelength λ, that is:  I suppose to show in the other place the expression for the intensity and one for the entropy of the in diathermal medium propagating radiation as well as the law of the increase of the total entropy in unstationary radiating process. I. The numeral values § 11 The values of both natural constants h and k may be calculated well precisely with a help of measurements available. F. Kurlbaum14 has found that if one designates by St the total energy, radiating into an air in 1 sec from the 1 cm2 surface of the black body exposed with t◦ , then it is:  From here the volume density of the total radiation energy in the air for the absolute temperature of 1 turns out: erg  From the other hand, according to (12), the volume density of the total radiation energy for ϑ = 1 is as follows: and by all terms integration it yields: Assuming it to be equal to 7.061 · 10−15 , one obtains, since c = 3 · 1010 , O. Lummer and E. Pringsheim15 have determined the product λm ϑ, where λm is the wavelength of the maximum of E in the air for the temperature ϑ, having value up to 2940 µ·grad. So in absolute units that is λm ϑ = 0.294 cm · grad. From the other hand, if one assumes the partial derivative of E in respect to λ to be equal to zero, so that λ = λm , then it follows from and from this transcendental equation one obtains From here and from (14) the values for the universal constants turn out: These are just the same values that I have presented in my recent communication.

16	Paper11	1939	On relativistic wave equations for particles of arbitrary spin in an electromagnetic field	On relativistic wave equations for particles of arbitrary spin in an electromagnetic field  The investigations of Dirac (1936) on relativistic wave equations for particles with arbitrary spin have recently been followed up by one of us (Fierz, 1939, referred to as (A)) It was there found possible to set up a scheme of second quantization in the absence of an external field, and to derive expressions for the current vector and the energy-momentum tensor. These considerations will be extended in the present paper to the case when there is an external electromagnetic field, but we shall in the first instance disregard the second quantization and confine ourselves to a c-number theory. The difficulty of this problem is illustrated by the fact that the most immediate method of taking into account the effect of the electromagnetic field, proposed by Dirac (1936), leads to inconsistent equations as soon as the spin is greater than 1. To make this clear we consider Dirac’s equations for a particle of spin 3/2, which in the force-free case run as follows:  where a\p = ajj0L and bff = b^d are symmetrical spinors. Dirac attempted to take the external electromagnetic field into account by replacing the spinor paf5 by Uap, which arises from it by substituting for — idjdxk ((f)k being the electromagnetic potentials). The 77a^ are then noncommuting operators satisfying the relations (cf. Appendix) where f a/}and f d^ are the two symmetrical spinors (faa = f d = 0) associated with the antisymmetrical field tensor By contracting this relation it follows that On the other hand, just as in the force-free case, we have  rom Dirac’s proposed equations Since the right-hand side is symmetrical in a and yd it follows that the sub- • sidiary condition It is to be remarked, however, that even in the force-free case such a system no longer leads to a wave equation of second order. (A closer discussion shows that these equations describe, besides particles of spin 3/2 and rest-mass k, also particles of spin 1/2 and rest-mass 2k). And further, the expression for the total charge turns out to be no longer positive definite, and this makes quantization consistent with the exclusion principle impossible (for quantization consistent with Bose statistics the total energy is, on the other hand, not positive for the case of half-integral spins). This modification was therefore abandoned and the equations (1) were retained for the force-free case. The problem then arose, besides replacing the p a/} by the ITa/5, of adding to these equations extra terms, depending on the field strengths, in such a way that they remained self-consistent in the presence of an external field. A completely analogous problem arises for integral spins. For instance, the field equations for spin 2, involving according to (A) a symmetrical tensor A ik, whose trace ^ A u vanishe The second set of conditions is indispensable if the total energy is to be positive definite. In fact if they were omitted those waves with only components of the type A4> would give rise to negative values of the total energy. On the other hand, the equations which arise from (5T), (5-2) when djdxk is replaced by d/dxk — ie<j)klhc are not compatible, for the operators 772= 2 n%and TIk are not commutative (ITk = —id/dxk — erf>k/hc). k We shall not attack the problem of deriving such additional terms to make the equations compatible directly but solve it by an artifice. This consists in introducing auxiliary tensors or spinors of lower rank than the original ones (for spin 3/2 they will be simple spinors ca and dd] for spin 2 a scalar C) and deriving all equations from a variation principle without having to introduce extra conditions. By suitably choosing the numerical coefficients in the Lagrange function it will follow from the field equations (derived from the variation) that in the absence of an external field the auxiliary quantities vanish and the additional conditions (5-2) or (1) are satisfied automatically (cf. § 2, equations (10), (11)). That such a procedure is reasonable seems to be shown by the fact that, for vanishing rest-mass, our equations for the case of spin 2 go over into those of the relativity theory of weak gravitational fields (i.e. = S ^ + y ^ , neglecting terms of order higher than the first in yA„); the “ gauge-transformations” are identical with the changes induced in y by infinitesimal co-ordinate transformations (§ 6). Although the following only deals in detail with the interaction of the particles and an external electromagnetic field, the interaction with other particles which can be absorbed and emitted could be formulated analogously. For instance, the interaction with a new scalar field ^ could be introduced by extra terms in the Lagrange function which arise from those in the Lagrangian of the following pages containing a factor k2 by replacement of k2 by ijr. On the other hand, it is important that a one-to-one correspondence should be possible between the states (eigenfunctions) with the external field and without. This is equivalent to saying that the number of conditions which the field and auxiliary variables (and their time-derivatives for integral spins) must satisfy at a definite time is not diminished by the presence of an external field. Otherwise, as is illustrated in Appendix I by a special example with particles of spin 1, singularities occur when the external field is made to vanish slowly. In the main text, however, this requirement of the continued existence of subsidiary conditions in an external field is always fulfilled. This requirement also seems important for the second quantization of the fields, a topic not treated in detail here. It enables one, namely, starting from the commutation rules of (A), to make an expansion of the commutation brackets of all field quantities in powers of the charge e. It is to be remarked that with particles of spin greater than 1 the charge-densities at different points no longer commute. A closer study of this circumstance, which strongly distinguishes the spin values of 0, 1/2, 1 (cf. A, Introduction) is to be desired. As may be seen from our last section (§8), our aim was not so much to set up the most general possible relativistic equations for particles of higher spin but rather to show that, in the present state of the theory, the existence of elementary particles of spin higher than 1 cannot be excluded, although the theory for such particles is considerably more complicated than for smaller spin values. In this  2. D erivation of the force-free equations from A VARIATION PRINCIPLE As an example of the theory of a wave-field corresponding to particles of spin higher than 1 in interaction with other fields let us first consider the theory for spin 2. As was shown in (A) such a field is described in the absence of external fields by a symmetrical tensor A ik of second rank, whose trace is zero, satisfying the wave equation is fulfilled. In this the indices i, k run from 1 to 4. stands for ( , y, z, ict) and □ = V2 —(1/c2) d2/dt2. Summation over indices occurring twice is to be understood. It can be shown that the total energy of the field is positive only if the extra condition (5*2) is satisfied, i.e. if the vector dAikjdxi does not vanish it describes particles of negative energy. If one introduces external fields, this must be done in such a manner that after they have been shut off the condition (5*2) is again fulfilled, so that no new particles of negative energy should be created. In order to discover a correct generalization of equations (5-1), (5-2) for external forces we shall look for a variation principle  will be useful to use a notation in which the time is separated from the other co-ordinates. We shall therefore discuss equations (12-1), (12*2) from this point of view. The field in the example considered belongs to the spin value / = 2, and therefore gives 2/ + 1 = 5 states for a given direction and frequency. The differential equations for the fields A ik and (7 are of second order. At a given time, therefore, one can prescribe the values of 5 components of A ik and their time-derivatives at all points of space. Since the field A ik has altogether (/+ l )2 = 9 components, there remain, together with the one component of (7, 5 components and their first time-derivatives which cannot be given at will. That is to say, there must be 10 subsidiary conditions,* containing * We would like to point out that we use the term “ additional conditions” in the sense of equations not following from a variation principle giving the main equations (§2, §4), whereas the term “ subsidiary conditions” refers to equations derived from the variation but which have the effect of reducing the number of degrees of freedom. perhaps higher space-derivatives, but only first derivatives with respect to time, from which, if 5 components of A ik and their time-derivatives are given, one can calculate the remaining ten quantities. These conditions can be derived from equations (12T) and (12-2). In the above-defined sense the following equations are to be regarded as subsidiary conditions: 3. Introduction of interactions The theory as presented up till now is equivalent to the theory in (A). By adding suitable terms to the Lagrangian we can introduce interactions with other fields. One must take care, however, that the subsidiary con- ditions are not impaired. This would mean that the dimensionality of the manifold of states was altered by “ switching on” the forces, and it turns out that these new states give rise to singularities when the field is “ switched off”, as we shall illustrate by means of an example in the Appendix. We shall here consider the effect of an electromagnetic field. In this case we must naturally assume that the fields and C are complex.

Theory with no forces In (A) it was shown that a force-free wave field corresponding to particles of spin 3/2 was described by spinors  (cf. also the explanations in the Appendix. We only wish to point out here that crjf is the Hermitian conjugate of—cr^). The second order wave equation for a\p and 6“^ follows from these equations. The additional conditions (17-2) mean that no particles of spin 1/2 are to be present. Fields which contain particles of spin 1/2 as well as of spin 3/2 have no longer a definite form for the total charges in the c-number theory and so cannot be quantized in accordance with the exclusion principle. On the other hand the latter.is physically necessary in order that the energy should be positive in the ^-number theory (cf. (A)). Equations (17T) and (17-2) can, as in the previous case, be derived from a variation principle if one introduces auxiliary variables ca and dd. A suitable choice of the constants in L again causes the quantities ca, dd, p ^ a jy, (which belong to the spin value to vanish as a consequence of the field equations in the force-free case. One has to choose for L the following:  One can now deduce from these equations that ca and da vanish, as well as that (17-2) is valid. To do this let us apply to the first of equations (19-1) and p ai to the first of equations (19-2), remembering tha 5. Introduction of forces One can now again introduce electromagnetic forces by replacing by 77a/j, where 77a/$ is the spinor corresponding to the I7k already defined. One then has the following equations:  This gives four subsidiary conditions. To be able to find four more we must separate time and space derivatives in (21-1), (21-2). For this we consider these equations in a co-ordinate system in which the time co-ordinate is fixed and therefore only require invariance under rotations of space. The spinor sd is then equivalent to sa, and 77“^ is equivalent to 77a/?, whereEquations (28) and (29) constitute 4 more subsidiary conditions. As a consequence of these 8 conditions the dimensionality of the states is unaltered by a field, and we can develop the theory in powers of the charge. In conclusion we give the current-charge density vectorIII. REST-MASS ZERO 6. Spin 2 One can set k equal to zero in the formulae derived above for and C and so obtain a theory for zero rest-mass. The equations then run tials. This condition restricts the gauge transformations to the group discussed in (A). The present scheme is identical with Einstein’s “ first approxim ation” of the gravitational equations. Einstein (1916) considers the equations for the gravitational field in the cases when the deviations from a Euclidean metric are small quantities of the first order. We write These equations are the same as those that Einstein gave for space containing no matter. The gauge transformation (33) occurs in the gravitational theory as an infinitesimal co-ordinate transformation. When interactions with matter occur and it is no longer sufficient to restrict oneself to the linear terms theThe effect of the transformation a'\ = ••• on the Lagrange function is again to add a complete differential. Whereas the theory for the spin value 2 has an important generalization for force fields, namely the gravitational theory, we here have no such connexion with a known theory. To get a generalization of the theory with interactions, one would first of all have to find a physical interpretation of the gauge group, and of the conservation theorem connected with this group. 8. General case of arbitrary spin To set up a theory with forces for particles of arbitrary spin one again first looks for a variation principle from which the equations of (A) can be derived. The forces can then be introduced by suitable modifications of theLagrange function. For instance, the effect of an electromagnetic field can be described by replacing — id/dxk by IJk. In generalizing the method which we have already used for the spin values 2 and 3/2 we must again introduce auxiliary fields, which, in the force-free case, vanish as a consequence of the field equations. To illustrate the method it will be sufficient to discuss the case of integral spin. We start from a tensor A{k bof ran k /, symmetrical in all its indices and whose trace A fu A vanishes. Let us further introduce auxiliary fields of r a n k /—2 ,..., s,.., 1, 0 which are likewise all symmetrical and of zero trace; there may be several fields with the same rank, which we shall distinguish by an index t. The general field occurring in the Lagrange function we shall thus denote by A sik h i,Jc,...,l being tensor indices, with respect to which the field is symmetrical, and t distinguishes the different fields of rank s. The index stakes the values 0, 1, . . . , / — 2,/. In general with a field A s of rank s one can associate 5+1 kinds of particles, i.e. those of spin s, s — 1, ..., 1, 0. The Lagrangian must be so constructed that in the end only those of spin / occur. Or we can say that as a consequence of the field equations all the fields corresponding to particles of spin/ — 1,..., 1,0 vanish. For L we choose the following: such that the same force-free theory follows as in (A). We have not yet been able to find any simple way of avoiding this ambiguity. In particular, it is impossible to manage with only one field of each rank, for one would then obtain n particles of spin/ — n and for n^ 5 only 4 constants to remove them. A completely analogous procedure also works for half-integral spin. The only difference lies in the fact that the Lagrangian contains derivatives of first order only, leading to a slight difference in the number of constants. It is to be remarked that already for 5/2 one must introduce fields corresponding to spin 1/2. As the method is otherwise the same as for integral spin there is no need to go into the details. Appendix (1) Forms of Lagrangian leading to singular solutions As we have already stressed, if one wants to modify the Lagrange function of the field for particles of spin ^ 1 in a manner corresponding to the interaction with other fields, one must take care that the number of restrictive conditions is not diminished. For then the switching on of the forces would create new particles whose corresponding particular solutions of the equations become singular when the field is switched off again. As an example of this we shall give an inadmissible form of interaction of particles of spin 1 with a scalar field fr.

Units and notation INCE the requirements  of relativity theory and quantum theory constitute the hypotheses of every theory it is natural to use h, the Planck constant, divided by 2m, and c, the velocity of' light in vacuum, as units. This means that all quantities are to be reduced to the dimensions of a power of Length by multiplication with the requisite powers of A and c. For example, the quantity E in the following will mean the energy divided by hc a magnitude with a dimension cm '; g will mean the momentum in terms of the unit A and will likewise be of the dimension cm ', I', the angular momentum in the unit k, is dimensionless; e, the electric charge in the unit (hc)& is dimensionless; the electromagnetic potential y; and the electromagnetic — field strengths f;s the unit (i'rc)& e, in — fs, hav— the dimensions cm ' and cm ', respectively. The reciprocal length associated with the rest mass m of a particle will be designated in the following by a=me/I'r. In accord with the above conventions we shall use the length so=et of the light path as the time coordinate; however, the imaginary tinle coordi* This report is an improved form of an article written for the Solvay Congress, 1939, which has not been published in view of the unfavorable times,  nate  will also be employed. Thus tensor indices designated by small italic letters which run from 1 to 4 involve the imaginary time coordinate. It is expedient to use in this connection a special rule for the transformation to complex conjugate quantities. For quantities with an index zero a star shall mean the conjugate complex in the ordinary sense (e.g. , ss* is the conjugate complex of the charge density ss,'s, is the current vector). In general we shall mean by U;k~ the conjugate complex   Dirac's spinors u, where p=i, , 4, are always given a Greek index which runs from 1 to 4; * means the conjugate complex of u, in the ordinary sense. %e shall denote wave functions, insofar as they are vectors or tensors, by the capital, letter U with components U;, U;~, . -, the symmetry character of the tensors is sometimes separately specified. The electromagnetic and gravitational fields occupy special positions in that they are classical and the rest masses of the particles associated with them are zero; we shall therefore use for them the usual symbols y, , f, & fs, andg;& = g&;, respectively. The energy-momentum tensor is defined so   energy-  tensor: gauge transformation  momentum  and. current vector (a) Xo external fields. First we shall consider all quantities as ordinary c numbers and proceed from a Lagrange function which depends on any functions  and their first derivatives,  This tensor can be obtained most simply, with the use of the invariance of the Lagrange function with respect to Lorentz transformations (including the three-dimensional rotations), in the following way. By means of the infinitesimal Lorentz transformation  is assumed to be zero at the limits, determines the field equations   We shall call the T, defined by (4) the canonical energy momentum tensor. It is in general not symmetric, nor is the energy density in general positive definite. In this connection it is necessary to bear in mind that for given values of the energy-momentum integrals the localization in space of the energy and momentum is uniquely determined only in the gravitation theory, where the production of the gravitational field gives tensor a direct physical the energy-momentum content. In the absence of interaction, the condition that the total energy be positive is a necessary  If b~L can be obtained by an infinitesimal the variation of the Lorentz transformation integral must vanish because of the Lorentz invariance of L. By considering (3) and (10a) we find'  definition (14) of the symmetric tensor has been given by energy-momentum Belinfante' and Rosenfeld. ' Since the localization of the energy plays a role principally in the theory of gravitation it is an important fact that tensor defined in the the energy momentum gravitation theory4 goes over into the one used above in the particular case of special relativity. It is to be noted, however, that the energy density obtained from the positive definite only in special cases. In order to prepare for the introduction of external electromagnetic fields, it is useful to divide the field quantities q into the complex quantities U(x), their complex conjugates U (x) which are to be considered as independent of U(x), and the real quantities V(x). Every sum over q then decomposes into sums over U, U* and V, so that, for example, the energy mo-  We postulate that the Lagrange function L, shall be invariant with respect to such phase changes with an arbitrary constant value of o., Differentiation of with respect to the phase then gives the relation where e is a constant.

It can, of course, be defined uniquely only if the external electromagnetic fields are given. The real fields, which permit no phase transformation of the form (17), describe particles which in general cannot be sources of e1ectromagnetic fields and which therefore have neither electrostatic nor magnetostatic properties. The electromagnetic field itself, which is associated in the particle picture with photons, is described however by the real fields. We have, for simplicity, assumed that all the complex fields contained in L, belong to particles of the same charge. If we wanted particles of different charges to be connected through these fields it would be necessary to require the invariance of I. with respect to transformations like (17) for the various U('& with dÃerent values n„of the phase Of for the diferent fields assosl,  The operator B/Bxq is left unchanged when applied to real fields V&'&; in the following  the existence of the field exhibits itself in the non-commutation of the operators DI, .

The field strengths are given by ciated with the diferent charges, which have to be proportional to the charges. (h) The presence of external electromagnetic fields. We expressly assume that all field equations are contained in, or follow from, the relations (3) which are a consequence of the variation principle, so that it is unnecessary to add any supplementary conditions. With this assumption it is possible to introduce an externa'I electromagnetic field by replacing the operation B/Bx), when applied to the U'"& in the Lagrange function and the wave equations, by the operator  In the derivative with respect to U("' we always keep the Uq&"& (not the B U&"&/Bx&„.) constant. However, if, in addition to these equations,  conditions form a part of the supplementary conditions obtheory, the new supplementary (21') may and tained by the substitutions (21) other with the equations not be compatible without additional terms. The theory obtained in this manner is invariant with respect to the gauge transformation  portance of the fact that the rest mass of the photons must be exactly zero for transformations of the second type is discussed in Part II, g2(c) and 2(e).) The following formal remark is of use for calculations in connection with the current vector and energy-tensor. Let f* be an arbitrary function of the  which is multiplied by e ' in a gauge transformation of the first type, and g another function of these quantities which is multiplied by e' . Then  may be an arbitrary function of position. This is always correct if the Lagrange function in the absence of external 6elds is invariant with respect to the transformation (17) with constant phase. For, from (1') it follows where now   since the terms which involve q ~ cancel. Similarly we have for the derivative of the gauge invariant with respect to x~. Lagrange function  The terms which include y cancel out as a result of relation (18) which remains valid when the meaning of U~'"', U~~'"' is changed according  It is because of this that the operators D~ in the lirst and D in the second Eq. (3') are consistent. Ke shouM like in particular to note the difference between 6elds like U&"), U*~") which under the gauge group suRers a transformation of the type (23a) which we shall call the gauge transformation of the first type, and 6elds, such as the electromagnetic 6eld, the potentials of which undergo gauge transformations of the second type (23b). This distinction is manifested through the fact that only expressions which are bilinear in U and U* are associated with physically measurable quantities even when the associated 6eM is quantized according to the Bose statistics. On the other hand the real 6elds V and the electroinagnetic field strengths (when quantized according to the Bose statistics) are measurable quantities. From this it follows that, in principle, only gauge invariant quantities can be obtained by direr. t measurement. (The im-  We define now the current vector s&, and the energy tensor T;&, as before by expressions (lt&) and (4). As a result of (3') the continuity Eq. (20)  continues to hold. From the tensor we obtain by making energy-momentum use of (3') and the expression for BL/Bx&:   It is necessary that this equation hold for the energy tensor of the original U field where there field since it is an external electromagnetic expresses the existence of the Lorentz force. It finally justifies our looking upon s& as the electromagnetic four-vector current. We have not yet considered the generation of the electromagnetic 6eld by means of the U 6eld. The above formulation suggests that this generation can be obtained by the Maxwell equation equation  since then the continuity atisfied where T;I, is the energy tensor of the U field and  is that of the electromagnetic field. However, the application of the particle picture, or the second quantization of the U field to this formulation of the rule for the generation of the electromagnetic field gives rise to the known dif6culties of the infinite self energy; these difficulties have not yet been overcome. Ke include here a discussion of the possibility of introducing additional terms in the Lagrange function which depend explicitly on the field strengths f, and which are consistent with the postulate of gauge invariance. The original definition of the current still applies and its continuity equation holds, but in place of (25) we have'  This makes additional terms in T;~: and sj, neces' sary, since for the new quantities T;I„-' and sI, the relation must be valid. The sA, can be found most easily from the equation which arises from the variation of qI„., current vector, and equation, tensor. The simplest example of a relativistically invariant wave equation is the scalar equation  (2)  and a=me/h where rn is the rest-mass and h is the quantum of action divided by 2x. Qle do not require that U be real. The wave Eq. (1) can be obtained from the variation principle  in which & is the charge of the particles measured in the natural unit (hc)'*. This current vector  in the additional term arises from the fact that the summations over r and s are independent. With this rule we have for the variation of the field strengths   Equation  which arise from (22). The use of such additional terms for the description of particles which have a magnetic moment will be discussed in Part II, $)2(d) and 3(a).   ' This sequence of factors proves convenient in the q number theory since it avoids a zero-point charge.  This likewise satis6es the continuity equation TH EO R I ES a cubic lattice of length I., the components of the wave numbers must be integral multiples The wave Eq.

We mention finally the theory which is dual to (1). In this the scalar U is replaced by a pseudo-scalar Up~ which is antisymmetric in all indices and the vector UA, by a pseudo-vector in all indices. U~~ which is also antisymmetric The equations analogous to (1) are then  space Ckarge. (b) Eigenstates in momentum It is known that the most coejngaIe solutions. general solution of (1) can be written as a sum of plane waves. If we introduce a large cube with so that the solutions are periodic edge length   Equation (14) shows that the eigenvibrations of negative frequency in the UP (and positive frequency ' in U) belong to states of negative charge. This is in agreement with the fact that the sign of the current vector changes when U and U* are interchanged in (4) whereas the tensor remains unchanged. energy momentum VJ'e can say, therefore, that the solution U* of * In cases where no ambiguity exists the (vector) quantities k and x will be indicated by italic type. the wave equation which is the conjugate complex of a given solution U(x, xo) is the "charge conjugate solution. This is also in accord with the treatment of the problem by means of the general principle of Part I when external electromagnetic fields are present. The principle requires that the wave Eq.

The theory given here must be associated with particles without spin since for a given k and a given sign of ko there exists only one eigenstate. We d.o not wish to base (c) Quantization the following discussion explicitly on the canonical formalism because an unnecessarily sharp distinction between time and space is introduced in this formalism, and this is convenient only in the absence of supplementary conditions involving the canonical variables at a given instant. %'e use here a generalization of the method of quantization first used by Jordan and Pauli in the case of the electromagnetic field. ' Moreover we shall require that the relation are the positive integers (including zero). It is this that makes the familiar transition to the particle picture possible. From (12), (13) and (14) it follows (as can be shown by familiar methods) that N+(k) and N (k) belong to the charge +e and the charge —e, respectively, and that both belong to the momentum +k. We see from (12) that for every value of k there is a zero-point ko', energy of the vacuum of one quantum, thus the zero-point energy per eigenstate present  '  The quantities U+(k}, U+~(k) are also very important when there is an interaction of the U 6eld with other 6elds. If, in this case, the Hamiltonian function is given by IIo+0 where IIo is the Hamiltonian operator for the force free case, and 0 is the interaction energy, Eq. (16}requires simply that RELATIVISTIC FIELD  THEORIES in the vacuum is a half quantum, as is the case in the electromagnetic 6eld. %'hen we go over to the bracket symbols of the field functions U(x, xp) themselves we find on using (11) and (19) that  The form of the D function is uniquely deterthat it satisfy the mined by the requirement  In the general case of x/0 the singularity on the light cone is still. given by this expression; however, D is no longer difFerent from zero inside the cone. In fact, one finds"   Ke turn now to a consideration of the quantization when the exclusion principle is assumed to be operative. Using the Hamiltonian function (8) or (12) as a basis for our procedure, we must require first of all that the relations (18) continue to hold where the bracket symbols have their previous meaning; on the other hand the expr essions follows as before that the first two of these brackets are always zero while the last is different from zero only if k=k' and the + or —indices on the two quantities occurring in the brackets are the same. Furthermore we have The last of the two equations exhibits a contradiction of the assumption that U* shall be the Hermitian conjugate of U, since if the is satisfied, the left side of the assumption equation is essentially positive. This assumption, however, is required in order that physical quantities, as for example the charge density sp   shall have real eigenvalues. %'e can also show that the scalar field theory cannot be quantized in accord with the exclusion principle without reference to the special. Hamiltonian and Eqs. (16). Besides the function D  there is another which is invariant satisfies the wave Eq. (1), namely,  If, however, the bracket with the plus sign is introduced, the left side is intrinsically positive for x=x', xp=xp', while the right side vanishes for xp —xp'. Thus we arrive at a contradiction similar to the one obtained above. The result of our arguments is that a relativistic theory for particles without spin based on general postulates must necessarily be quantized in accord with the Einstein-Bose statistics. (d) A real geld. In this case we always have U= U*; the current vector vanishes identically; the associated particles cannot generate an electromagnetic field. For the Lagrange function and energy momentum tensor we write: Xp is the Neumann function; IIp"' is the first Hankel cylinder function. The strongest singularity of D~ which occurs on the light cone is defined by (23) even in the general case of «WO. Since the scalar field U(x, xo) must satisfy the wave equation (1) and must be relativistically invariant, wp have as the only possibilities the relations  where c and c~ are constants. Ke shall therefore expressly postulate for the following that any two physical quantities, the relative coordinates of which lie outside the light cone, commute. As a consequence the left side of (26) must vanish for such points if we use the plus sign. in the ordiOtherwise the non-commutativity, nary sense, of the gauge invariant quantities which are bilinear in U and U*, e.g. , the charge density, would follow. The justification of our postulate lies in the fact that measurements at space-time points which have a space-like connection line can never perturb one another since signals cannot be propagated with a velocity greater than that of  An additional relation exists between the coefficients of the I'ourier expansion (11)  RELATIVISTIC F IELD THEORIES relations (11) remain valid  The commutation vanish. From Eq. (29) we see that the zero-point energy of the 'ko, per eigenvacuum is again a half quantum, state. In place of (21) we have  while the brackets In the quantization in accord with the exclusion principle there are two possibilities: either the energy becomes a constant c number, which is impossible, or the function D j appears in the right of (32), which contradicts our previous postulates. It may be noted that the original form of the theory with a complex function U is clearly equivalent to one with two real fields V= V*, 8'= lP' which correspond to the real and imaginary parts of U. In this connection it is useful to introduce a factor 1/N so that no numerical factor occurs in the commutation relations. %e put, therefore The current vector, however, is The "abbreviated" theory with a single real field V can be obtained from the above by striking out S' and setting the current vector equal to zero.  2. Wave Sells for particles of spin  (a) The c number theory for case of no external fields. This case holds the center of current interest since Yukawa supposed the meson to have spin 1 in order to explain the spin dependence of the force between proton and neutron. The theory for this case has been given by Proca. The simplest possibility for a generalization of the theory formulated in $1 seems to be that which is obtained by introducing a vector field U~ which satisfies the wave equation  and the components of which are treated as independent scalars. It is easy to see, however, that with such a formulation the component U4=iUO gives rise to negative terms in the energy when the signs are so taken that the space-like components of the vector U~ are (34)— associated with positive energy terms. This difficulty can be removed by requiring, in addition to (38), the supplementary condition  tion relations of the form (31), we obtain for the energy E and the momentum G the sum of two expressions, one in U and one in 8', of the form (29) and (30), respectively; for the charge we find on the other hand  If the V and 8 are expanded in terms of the eigenstates according to (28) with the commuta-  The meaning of this becomes especially clear in the rest system of the particle where the wave held depends periodically on the time but not on space coordinates. In this system (39) requires the vanishing of U4., from this it is clear that in this case, as a consequence of (39) the energy is necessarily positive. It follows from the Lorentz invariance of the theory that in general the total energy E (the volume integral of the energy density) is positive. It will appear later that we can also prove for this case that the energy density at every space point is positive de6nite.  A skew-symmetric tensor U;&= —UI, ;, which is related to the UI, as the field strengths are related to the potential in electrodynamics can be formed from the UI, by a rotation:  This can be transformed into a symmetric tensor. Following the general formulation of Part I,  are certain advantages  in considering as the basic equations of the theory as derived,  equations  remaining  From (37) it follows on the one hand that  so that from the vanishing of the second divergence we can conclude the vanishing of the first, and on the other hand that   from which it is clear that it makes no difference whether the total energy and total momentum is calculated by means of the canonical or the symmetric tensor. From (41) we get for the energy density on the introduction of the quantities  This relation is important in that it shows that U; is uniquely defined by a given U;&, just as the U;k is defined by U, from (40). As a consequence, for non-vanishing rest-mass, the addition of a gradient to U; is not permitted. Hence no of the second kind exist gauge transformations for the U; when x&0. It is worth noting that (38) and (39) follow from (40) and (41). When (41) is dilferentiated with respect to x, and summed over i, the first term vanishes because of the skew symmetry of U, I, and we get (39). Equation (36) then follows upon the substitution of (40) into (41). Finally we have from (40) the relations The expressions N+(k) and N (k) are bilinear forms in the three components of U and U*. They can be brought into diagonal form and normalized if the U and U* are divided into a component parallel to k (longitudinal vibration) and two components perpendicular to k (transverse vibration). Let e1 and e2 be two complex orthogonal unit vectors normal to k  This is simply the transformation to the principal axis. Befo. re we formulate the commutation relations we shall point out a difference (c) Quantization between the special case x=0 the electrodynamics and the one in which we are interested. In the electrodynamics it is usual to quantize the vector components U; as independent scalars in accord with an immediate generalization of (21) on the left of this relation need not commute with all other quantities but gives zero when applied to the Schrodinger function 4. But it is required of an auxiliary condition that it commute with its conjugate complex at di8'erent space-time points. In our case a simple calculation shows that   However, , and for ~/0 the right side is not zero. %e have the result, therefore, that for rest-mass the commutation relations for the U; cannot be the same as those for non-vanishing independent scalars. The simplest method for getting a consistent second quantization in the case TWO (which we now expressly assume) is to formulate the commutation relations in such a way that not only the wave Eq. (38) but also the supplementary Eq. (39) is identically satisfred as equations in q numbers. Such a formulation is the following:  Note that (61) leads to expressions for which are different from zero in contradistinction to the results obtained from the "canonical" commutation relations.  Thus the supplementary condition is consistent. Furthermore this makes the total energy positive provided the Lagrange function consists of a sum of contributions from the independent field components A;, B. Then the U; which satisfy the relation  The U; are invariants with respect to this transformation group. The advantage of this method, as Stuckelberg shows, is that the interaction between the mesons described by such fields and protons and neutrons can be handled by a formalism which is completely analogous to that employed by Dirac" for the treatment of the interaction between light and electrons. In the following, however, we shall not introduce the auxiliary fields, and shall treat the supplementary Eq. (39) simply as an identity.  Dirac, Quantum Mechanics (Oxford, 1935), second edition. In the case of mesons the supplementary conditions on A; and 8 remain homogeneous even in the interaction with the heavy particles (this is not so in the analogous case for light) while on the other hand additional terms occur in UO which arise from the difference between digqrentiation with respect to the time of the meson held and with respect to general time.  The only arbitrariness which yet remains in (61) is associated with the possible introduction of a numerical factor on the right side. This is connected through Eq. (16) with the corresponding normalization of the numerical factor in the Hamiltonian operator. Vje show here that the normalization of (61) is in agreement with the use of (44) for the energy momentum tensor. For this purpose the decomposition of the fields into eigenstates is most suitable. In the calculation of the energy expression one must take into consideration the order of the factors. As can be seen from Eq. (12), the factors in the terms arising from the U(k) and U*(k) appear in an order which is the reverse of that in Eq. (55). As is shown further by the comparison with (18), Eqs. (16) require that the commutation relations for the U, (k) and U„*(k) be   Introducing these results into Eqs. (50), (51), we get agreement with (61) for D given by (22). We see, therefore, that the quantities N+(k) and E (k) defined tkrougk (65) give the number vf particles with chcrf e +1 and —1, respectively, and with momentum k. The sequence of factors in the energy expression leads, as in )1 (6) to a zero point energy of a half quantum per eigenstate. As in the scalar theory it is impossible to quantize in accord with the exclusion principle for the function [1—(8'/Bx k) $D vanishes for xk =xo' just as D does. The distinction between longitudinal and transverse vibrations is lost in the rest system for the particle, i. e. , for the case k=0. The introduction of the normal vibrations according to (59) is superfluous as well as singular since the second part of (65) vanishes. Moreover, as follows from (51) and as has already been mentioned, U0=0. For a given sign of the frequency, therefore, we have in the rest system three characteristic solutions which can be transformed into one another by spatial rotations of the coordinate systems. The statement that the field theory under discussion, when quantized, describes particles of spin 1, and only such particles, is thus justified. (d) The c number tkeory when there is an external electromagnetic field. The general rule of I CI2(b) for the extension of the Geld equations when an external field is present may be immediately applied if we begin with the variation principle. By means of the operators   It is to be noted that Eqs. (67), (68), which can be derived directly from the variation principle, are distinguished through the fact that they contain no terms in which f;«occurs explicitly. Expression (49) for the current vector is unchanged in this theory except for the altered meaning of the U;«, in accord with I, $2(b), we have for the energy tensor, instead of (44)  this can be transformed into the symmetric tensor 8„«of Eq. (46) which, therefore, energy remains valid. The discussion of the non-relativistic limiting case shows" that the particle described by the field possesses a magnetic moment which has the same ratio to the mechanical moment as for the classical rotating charge, namely ek/2moc. However, this result is not unique. It is possible to introduce new terms into the Lagrange function of the form  in which X is a dimensionless factor. This leads  		W.Pauli
19	Paper12_3	1941	Relativistic Field Theories of Elementary Particles'	THEORIES  The current vector and the charge vanish. Recently this possibility has been introduced for the description of neutral mesons. An important and in a certain sense a singular special case is that of vanishing rest-mass m =0. As is well known, this case includes the quantum electrodynamics. The Lagrange function and the energy tensor depend only on the U;I, . The equations derived from the action principle  together with the U;I, remain invariant if an arbitrary gradient is added to U~,. or, in other of the second words, in gauge transformations kind  This transformation seems to establish a fundamental and qualitative difference between the cases a=0 and l~:AO. On this basis an assumption to the eR'ect that the photons have a very small but finite rest mass seems to be physically unsatisfactory. Since a gauge transformation of the first kind could not be applied to the photon of the field if ~=0, the gauge transformation second kind with phase factor which depends arbitrarily on space and time, exp [iot(x, x, ) would no longer be possible for electron and proton fields. We mention here the possibility of a complex field for the case ~ = 0; a current vector s~ is then defined by (49). The current vector would not then be invariant with respect to the substitution (72) but the volume integrated total charge would be. (This can be seen by use of Eq. (49).) However, we know of no case of «=0 and integral spin which requires for its description a complex field (or tsvo real fields). We shall, therefore, assume that the (U;, U;«) field is real and identify it with the photon field (y, , f;«) The singularity of the case ff:=0 exhibits itself in the c number theory through the fact that for this case Eq. (39) and the wave equation of the second order (38) for U, are no longer consequences of Eqs. (40') and (41'). In the q number theory the commutation relations (61) become singular. There are two methods for   For small velocities of the particle this change introduces a factor (1+K) into the original expression for the magnetic moment; the moment, therefore, can be given an arbitrary value. (e) Remarks on real folds and the special case of vanishing rest mass. The tra-nsition to real fields is accomplished by means of the scheme of $1(d); we put U«= (1/v2)(V«+iW«) where U« and t/t/I, are real. The theory with a single real vector is obtained by identifying Uq and U~ in a position space and in the momentum space by identifying the U+(k) and U (k). Instead of X+(k) and X (k) one obtains in the expression for the energy and momentum only the one number  formulating the theory when ~=0. One consists no commutation relations for in introducing quantities which are not invariant with respect to the substitution (72) and retaining the commutation relations (63) for the field strengths with unrestricted validity of the gauge group. The other method was developed by Fermi" and has certain advantages in calculations on the interaction between light and charged particles. In this theory the supplementary condition for the state under consideration, and the wave equation of the second order for the vector potential  are introduced as q number relations. The latter equations introduce a limitation on the gauge group to such as satisfy the second order wave equation However, this limitation makes it possible to require the following simple commutation relations for the y;. momentum photon is given by positron theory Only the two transverse vibrations associated with r=1, 2, appear in the energy expression, and for a given k there are only two physically different states. As mentioned in Part I the spin of the photon is exhibited through the fact that the lowest eigenvalue of the square of the total angular is the component of U normal to shall not give a proof of the existence of A for Lorentz transformations. Ke note simply that the matrix A is defined by (75) only to within a constant factor. Ke shall limit this factor to the four roots of unity ~1; +i by the additional requirement  For the proper (continuous)  sign is now uniquely determined in (76+) as can be shown by a continuity argument with (75) and (75+); for the reflections of the space coordinates or the time the factor ~ i or ~z in A and the sign in (76+) remains undefined. In the following it will prove to be useful to take the the sign of the time coordinate is changed whereas the space components s~ do then experience a change in sign. A reversal of the signs of all coordinates, therefore, leaves the sI, unchanged. On the other hand the energy tensor changes sign, as can also be seen from (76+) when the signs of all coordinates are changed. We consider now the up which are plane waves with a definite propagation vector (Ir, ko). From (73a) it again follows that k02=k'+ii'. It is seen that for a given k and a given sign of ko there are two solutions of the wave Eqs. (73) or (78) which, in the rest system @=0, may be transformed into one another by spatial rotations. The particles associated with these waves thus have the spin ~. We want now to investigate more closely the connection between the solutions It is noteworthy that for the electron the magnetic moment is just -', (e/~) so that the additional term is unnecessary. The situation is diR'erent, however, for both proton and neutron. The magnetic moment of the latter must be obtained from the new term alone for, as &=0, the substitution of D& for 8/Bx& is unnecessary. It is also important that in going to the charge conjugate solution the sign of 3 must change together with that of e, these solutions are thus also conjugate with respect to the magnetic moment of the particle (see I, fj2). It should be noted that the additional term introduces a new constant with the dimension of a length into the theory. For a discussion of the consequences, for the case of spin 1, of additional terms in the Lagrangian and the resulting terms in the current vector, see $2(d). (b) Quantisation in accord with the exclusion principle. —We have seen that for spin -', the energy in the c number theory is not positive definite; there are just as many negative as positive energy eigenvalues. This condition mould be unchanged through the introduction of Einstein-Bose quantization. Dirac has pointed out, however, that the difficulties of the negative energy states are eliminated through a change in the definition of the vacuum if quantization in accord with the exclusion principle is introduced. The vacuum is defined as the state with the smallest energy among those having values for the occupation numbers of the states which are compatible with the exclusion principle. This limits the values of the occupation numbers of a non-degenerate eigenstate to 0 and 1. The vacuum therefore is defined as that total state in which all individual negative energy states are occupied. The absence of a particle from a negative energy state, a so-called hole, then behaves, relative to the newly defined vacuum, as a particle with positive energy and opposite charge to the original. This formulation of the Dirac theory of holes is not entirely symmetric with respect to the two particles of opposite charge. We shall follow below a formalism proposed by Heisenberg" which expresses the same physical content in more symmetric manner. For this purpose we begin with the formulation of the commutation relation for the wave functions. When the exclusion principle applies, we must consider, according to Jordan and Wigner, the bracket4. A special synthesis of the theories for spin 1 and spin 0 We write the Eqs. (1) for the wave field of a particle without spin in a form which is analogous to that of (73).The Pq in this equation are 5-rowed matrices; four rows operate on the vector U~, the fifth on the scalar U. We shall represent the field components, (ii) &Uit, (ii)&U as U, with p=1, 2, 5, and use Pizz as an abbreviation for +Pi„zz,. Th, e factor (ii) & before Ui and the (i~)» before U are introduced to make the equations more symmetric; in this notation u*u has the dimensions of a reciprocal volume as in the Dirac theory. Equations (41), (42) for the field in the case of spin 1 can also be written in the form (110). For this purpose the P~ must be four 10-rowed matrices four rows of which operate on the vector U~ and six on the skew-symmetric tensor U;~. The field components (z)&Uq, (~) &U;i are represented as u, with p =1, . ~, 10. Du%n30 has noticed the interesting fact that both the 5-rowed and the 10-rowed matrices fulfill the commutation relationships. The algebra generated by these relations can be studied independently of special representations of the hypercomplex numbers P just as was the case for the algebra based on Dirac's y;. The four matrices Pi the unit matrix I, and all powers and products of the P~ generate 126 linearly independent quantities. [The number of independent powers and products is limited by (111).]A 5-rowed and a 10-rowed representation of this algebra have already been specified. Beside these there is a trivial 1-rowed representation in which the PI, are zero and I is just 1. These representations are irreducible in theS. Applications* AVe conclude this report with some simple applications of the theories discussed in Part II, Ia)I, 2(d) and 3(a), of the interaction of particles of spin 0, 1, and -,'with the electromagnetic field. In the last two cases we denote the value eh/2ilIc of the magnetic moment as the normal one, where 3f is the rest mass of the particle. The assumption of a more general value y(eh/2ilIc) for the magnetic moment demands the introduction of additional terms, proportional to y —1, in the Lagrangian or Hamiltonian. These terms are given, for spin 1, by Eq. (66'), with y= I+X, and for spin —, ' by Eq. (9'), with y = 1—(2M'c/h) L(hc) &/eel. The applications which we consider are the radiationless collision of two charged particles, the Compton effect, brems-strahlung, and pair generation. Since the cross sections for these processes may be used to understand the nature of the penetrating component of cosmic radiation, we shall for convenience use the word "mesotron" to denote the particle, of charge e, to which various values of the spin and the magnetic moment are attributed. (a) Radiationless collision of mesotrons with electrons. —In Table I is given the cross sections for the scattering of mesotrons by a Coulomb field with a fixed center; in Table II the cross sections for a mesotron in electromagnetic interaction with an electron, in the coordinate system in which the electron is initially at rest. The cross sections are calculated by the well-known method of Mftller, introducing the matrix elements of the interaction of the electron with the electromagnetic field produced, according to the different theories, by the mesotron. In both this process and the process of bremsstrahlung, discussed in (c), we are interested particularly in the case in which the initial energy Bo of the mesotron is large compared with 3IIc'. The results given in Table II and in rows III and V of Table I hold only for this case, giving the leading terms in n=EO/cVc'. In both tables, cases III and IV are one order of magnitude in g greater than I and II, and V is again one order of magnitude larger than III and IV. Both here and for all other processes discussed below the cross sections for a given value of theorder than I and II. The transition probabilities for the Compton effect and the emission process are not independent of each other, for the latter may be also calculated by the method of virtual quanta4' (although for case IV this method must be controlled by the direct method). The virtual quanta method consists in considering the coordinate system in which the mesotron is at rest and taking the Fourier expansion of the field of the quickly moving nucleus. The scattering of a light quantum out of this held, the cross section for which may be taken from the formulae for the Compton effect, then corresponds in the rest system of the nucleus to the emission of a quantum. Very closely connected with the emission of a light quantum is the process of pair generation by a quantum. Indeed, according to the theory of holes, the process involved is of the same kind as the emission process, the only differences being that (in the case of pair production) the light quantum is present in the initial and absorbed in the final state, and that the electron in the initial state has a negative energy. The orders of magnitude of the cross sections for pair-production (Table IVA) are the same as for the corresponding bremsstrahlung processes. Even if the fundamentals of the various theories are correct, some limitation of the validity of the derived results arises from the 40 C. v. 'tA'eiszacker, Zeits. f. Physik 88, 612 (1934). fact that the cross sections as calculated by the perturbation theory are only a first approximation. This is especially important in the cases of spin ~~, with an anomalous magnetic moment, and spin 1 for which particles the cross sections increase with increasing energy. The validity of the first approximation of the perturbation theory in these cases has been discussed by Oppenheimer" and by Landau. " The first author uses the criterion that in the coordinate system in which the mesotron and the light quantum have equal and opposite momenta the interaction energy between the mesotron and the quantum must be small compared with the unperturbed energy of either one. The second author employs the condition that the transition probabilities for all othe' processes that could arise from the same initial state (the emission of several pairs or light quanta, for example) must be small in comparison with the probability for the process in question. For bremsstrahlung, pair generation and the Compton effect, these two criteria give, for cases III and IV, the same condition Eo&(hc/e')Mc' or hv&(hc/e')Mc' " On the other hand, for spin 0 and for spin ~, with normal magnetic moment these criteria are fulfilled for all energies if (Ze'/hc)«1. Although it is clear that these criteria are certainly necessary conditions for the validity of the first approximation of the perturbation theory, a closer investigation of the sufficiency of these conditions (particularly for spin 0) would be desirable. Such an investigation demands a discussion of the higher approximations of the perturbation theory.

In particular, the relations between the equations of Bardeen & Press, of Zerilli and of Regge &  Wheeler are explicitly established. 1. INTRODUCTION  The equations governing the perturbations of the vacuum Schwarzschild metric the Schwarzschild black hole - have been the subject of many investigations (Regge & Wheeler I957; Vishveshwara 1970; Edelstein & Vishveshwara I970; Zerilli Fackerell I97I; Bardeen & Press I972; Friedman I973). Nevertheless, there continues to be some elements of mystery shrouding the subject. Thus, Zerilli (I970a) showed that the equations governing the perturbation, properly analysed into spherical harmonics (belonging to the different I values) and with a  time dependence eiat, can be reduced to a one dimensional Schrodinger equation of (Here, units are used in which c = G - 1.) Accordingly, the reflexion and the transmission coefficients for incident plane waves of various assigned wavenumbers, will clearly suffice 'to determine the evolution of any initial perturbation of the Schwarzschild black hole. This reduction of the general perturbation problem to the elementary one of determining the reflexion and the transmission coefficients of a one dimensional potential barrier is, of course, a remarkable simplification. But what is the origin of the particular form of the potential Vz? Again, considering a particular component of the Riemann tensor - the perturbed  Newman-Penrose 8Jo'-Bardeen & Press (I973) showed that all the physical results relative to the perturbation of the Schwarzschild black hole can equally be derived from the solutions of the equation appropriate for ingoing waves at- the horizon (r* -? - oo) and outgoing wav infinity (r* -> + oo). If, as claimed, the physical contents of equations (1) and (4) entirely the same, then there must be a simple relation between the functions Z  and 0 which makes this equivalence manifest. But what is this relation? In this paper we shall give a coherent, self-contained account of the theory of the  perturbations of the Schwarzschild black hole while resolving at the same time some  of the unanswered questions, in particular, the relation between the Zerilli and the Bardeen-Press equations..  2. THE EQUATIONS GOVERNING THE PERTURBATIONS OF THE SCHWARZSCHILD BLACK HOLE  The vacuum metric of Schwarzschild written in its standard form is  ds2 =- (1- )(dt)2+r2sin2O(dy)2? (dr)2 +r2(dO)2. (6) Because of this spherical symmetry, first order perturbations of this metric can be analysed into spherical harmonics belonging to the different I and m values. Perturbations belonging to a particular I and m will be axisymmetric about some axis. Accordingly, there will be no loss of generality in restricting ourselves to axisymmetric perturbations from the outset.  As has been shown (Chandrasekhar & Friedman 1972) a form of the metric adequate for treating time-dependent axisymmetric systems in general relativity is where v V', 2, 3, w, q2, and q3 are all functions of t and the spatial variables x2 and x3 but independent of the azimuthal angle y. WVith the identifications  the Schwarzschild metric corresponds to the various metric functions having the values When the metric is perturbed, we shall write for the corresponding metric functions while w, q2, and q3 will be considered as quantities of the first order of smallness like bv, 8A, 85f, and b4a3. The equations governing the various quantities describing the perturbations can  be readily written dowvn by transcribing in the present context the various equations This equation follows from Chandrasekhar & Friedman (1972; equation (153)) by substituting for i/i, v, etc., their present values. We observe that (1 1 b) is independent of the other field variables: it governs the 'so-called' odd-parity perturbations.  Equation (11b) is considered in the appendix. Of the remaining field equations, it will suffice to consider the (0, 2)-, (0, 3)-, (2,3)-, and (2,2)-components. These equations are where we have further assumed a time dependence exp With the foregoing substitutions, equation (13) at once gives Similarly, equations (15) and (16) give Equation (23), after the elimination of T, takes the form It will be observed that equations (21), (22), and (25) provide three linear first order equations for the three radial functions L, N, and V. By suitably combining  them, we can express the derivative of each of them as linear combinations of L, N, Equations (27), (28), and (29) provide the basic equations of the theory. All the remaining field equations, including equation (24), are verifiable consequences of these equationst For later use, we may note here the following equation obtained by adding equations (28) and (29) 3. ZERILLI'S EQUATION  We shall verify that by virtue of equations (27)-(29), the function, satisfies Zerilli's equation (1).  First, we observe that an equivalent expression for Z is r2  Z =rV-2 (L+ X). (34) nr + 3m Differentiating this expression with respect to the variable  r =r+2mlg (rm1) (r > 2m), (35) t In Regge & Wheeler's discussion (Regge & Wheeler I957) of this same problem, in a  gauge different from the one adopted in this paper, the corresponding situation is somewhat curious. They obtain a set of six equations for three scalar functions. Three of these equations are of the first order while the remaining three are of the second order. They say 'one will expect that the three first order equations will suffice to determine the solution apart from the boundary conditions. Actually, the second order equations contain an additional piece of information... specifically, a rather elaborate investigation shows that [the second order equations] can all be deduced from [the first order equations]' provided a linear combination, F (say), of the three scalar functions vanishes. At the same time Vishveshwara (I970) says that if F, is evaluated with the aid of the first order equations, F, P --V,F and that therefore 'if F = 0 for some r, it is zero everywhere'. All this is somewhat confusing. In any event, when working in the gauge adopted in this paper, all the second order equations are identically satisfied by virtue of the first order equations (27)-(29) and no 'additional piece of information' is provided.  Differentiating this last expression., once again, with r with the aid of equations (24), (29), and (34), we find after some considerable reductions that, remarkably, we are left with  d2Z/dr2 +(o2-VVZ)Z Z0, (37) where Vz is given by equation (2). Thus, Zerilli's equation, while it is a directly verifiable consequence of equations (27)-(29), the manner in which it emerges is shrouded in (apparently) miraculous cancellations.  An interesting integral property of Zerilli's potential Vz may be noted here: 4. THE EXPRESSION OF WF0 IN TERMS OF ZERILLI'S FUN-CTION  In another connexion, Friedman (1973; ? 3 of this paper) has already cons  the perturbed components of the Riemann tensor; and the component 5W. the Bardeen-Press equation (4) refers is Expressions for the components of the Riemann tensor (in the tetrad-frame in whieh they are referred) have been given by Chandrasekhar & Friedman (I 972; equations (16)) under general time-dependent axisymmetric conditions. Specializing them to  the case on hand, we find that in accordance with equationi (39) (cf. Friedmr3a: 11973, equation (56))  In the further use of this expression, we shall suppress the angular dependence  (I, -P 0 cot 0) and the factor 2 eit as well. With this understanding, we can rewrite  the expression for B&1' in the following form after eliminating Kr in the sec in parenthesis on the right hand side with the aid of equation (29):   Making use of equations (34) and (36) giving Z and Z,,,we find that we ean express b&I" in terms of these quantities; we find We observe that in the first term in braces on the right hand side of equa  the coefficient of Z is, apart from a factor r2/(r - 2m) the potential V equation. In making use of this fact we shall find it convenient to introduce the operators We now rewrite the expression (43) for 8PJ in the manner Equation (47) suggests that we define the fiun  It is noteworthy that in this last equation, expr appears as the coefficient of Z.  Perturbations of the Schwarzschild black hole 297 On simplifying this last equation, we are left with  it can now be readily verified that we recover equation (4) of Bardeen & Press.  Even as equations (56) and (57), together with Zerilli's equation, enabled us to derive the Bardeen-Press equation, we may, conversely, derive Zerilli's equation from equations (51) and (55) together with the Bardeen-Press equation in the form (61). 6. CONCLUDING REMARKS  In bringing together in a common framework the different equations which govern  the perturbations of the Schwarzschild black hole and clarifying their inner relation, the present paper raises the question whether one may not be able to simplify some, at least, of the aspects of the perturbation problem as it pertains to the Kerr black  hole. Thus, Teukolsky's equation (Teukolsky I973) governing the perturbations of  the Kerr black hole reduces, when specialized to the Schwarzschild black hole, to the Bardeen--Press equation (4) and not to the Zerilli equation (1). The question naturally arises whether there may not be a transformed version of the Teukolsky  equation, which when specialized to the Schwarzschild case becomes the Zerilli equation. Such a transformation, if it were possible, would clearly be advantageous: we shall then need to determine only the reflexion and the transmission coefficients  for a one-dimensional potential barrier. In a subsequent paper (Chandrasekhar & Detweiler, in preparation) it will be shown how Teukolsky's equation, for the case  of axisymmetric perturbations, can be transformed into a one-dimensional wave equation with, indeed, four possible potentials. The research reported in this paper has in part been supported by the National  Science Foundation under grant GP-34721X1 with the University of Chicago and the Louis Block Fund.  In the course of an investigation of Teukolsky's equation (Chandrasekar & Detweiler, in preparation), it became clear that the Regge-Wheeler equation governing the odd-parity perturbations of the Schwarzschild metric must also be equivalent to the Bardeen-Press equation. We give a brief ab initio demonstration of this equivalence.  The variables r and 0 in equation ( 11 b), governing the odd-parity perturbations, can be separated by the substitution,  Q = rX(r)P1+2(cos0/-3),	 A coherent self-contained account of the equations governing the pertur-  bations of the Schwarzschild black hole is given.. In particular, the relations  between the equations of Bardeen & Press, of Zerilli and of Regge &  Wheeler are explicitly established.	 S. Chandrasekhar
21	Paper14	1976	Notes on black-hole evaporation	PHYSICAL REVIEW D  VOLUME 14, NUMBER 4 15 AUGUST 1976  Notes on black-hole evaporation W. G. Unruh~t Department of Physics, Miller Institute for Basic Research, University and Department  of Applied  of California,  Berkeley, California 94720  Mathematics, McMaster University, Hamilton, Ontano, Canada  This paper examines various aspects of black-hole evaporation. A two-dimensional model is investigated where it is shown that using fermion-boson cancellation on the stress-energy tensor reduces the energy outflow to zero, while other noncovariant techniques give the Hawking result. A technique for replacing the collapse by boundary conditions on the past horizon is developed which retains the essential features of the collapse while eliminating some of the difficulties. This set of boundary conditions is also suggested as the most natural set for a preexistent black hole, The behavior of particle detectors under acceleration is investigated where it is shown that an accelerated detector even in flat spacetime will detect particles in the vacuum. The similarity of this case with the behavior of a detector near the black hole is brought out, and it is shown that a geodesic detector near the horizon will not see the Hawking flux of particles. Finally, the work of Berger, Chitre, Nutku, and Moncrief on scalar geons is corrected, and the spherically symmetric coupled scalar-gravitation Hamiltonian is presented in the hope that someone can apply it to the problem of black-hole evaporation.  INTRODUCTION  Hawking'' has recently advanced arguments to suggest that black holes evaporate, due to quantum particle creation, and behave as though they had an effective temperature of (8vM) ', with M the mass of the black hole. This paper is an attempt to investigate the assumptions which lead to this result, and so discover whether such an evaporation is physically reasonable or is the result of difficulty in defining spacephysical particles on a non-flat-background  time. Section I will examine the collapse of a spherical shell of matter to a black hole in a two-dimensional model. Here the field equations for massless fields are exactly solvable. Following the procedure used by Hawking gives a constant particle production rate long after collapse in this twodimensional example, just as in the four-dimensional problem. This particle production is associated with an energy flow out to infinity only if the energy-momentum tensor is regularized in a particular, noncovariant fashion at infinity. methods are A variety of other renormalization suggested. The only one which is actually investigated gives no energy flow out of the black hole, no black-hole  evaporation. This technique used for regularization in two dimensions is to cancel the infinities in the boson tensor (taken as a massless energy-momentum scalar field) with those in the fermion energy-mo' mentum tensor (taken as that of a massless spin- —, field). Such a cancellation could be extended to four dimensions where the worst divergences in 14  the energy-momentum tensor would be canceled (i.e. , the ~' divergences). The two-dimensional result suggests that black-hole evaporation may be linked to these divergent parts of the energymomentum tensor. Section II of the paper discusses an attempt to replace the difficult collapse problem with an equivalent formulation in full empty Schwarzschild spacetime. Here the collapsing body is replaced by boundary conditions on the past horizon of the black hole. In particular, the definition of positive frequency for normal modes which come out of the past horizon of the black hole is changed from the naive formulation. Instead of defining positive frequency for these modes via the timelike Killing vector, it is defined for the initial data on the past horizon via a null vector field which is of Killing type on the horizon (only). The Feynman propagator is briefly investigated in the two methods of defining positive frequencies. It is suggested that the usual definition of positive frequencies leads to a propagator divergent on the future horizon, which the alternative method does not. Replacing the collapsing star with these boundary conditions on the past horizon gets rid of the difficulty of solving the scalar, neutrino, etc. field equations in the time-dependent metric of a collapsing star. Analyzing this problem by the same method used by Hawking leads to exactly the result obtained by him a long time after the collapse of the star, i.e. , a constant outward flux of particles as if the black hole had a temperature (8vM) '. Section III discusses the problem of particle detection by model particle detectors. It is shown that an accelerated detector in flat spacetime will detect quanta even in the vacuum. A discussion of  the applicability to the black-hole evaporation process is given. Section IV is a digression to a completely different possible attack on the black-hole evaporation problem. Essentially it is a revision of the work of Berger, Chitre, Moncrief, and Nutku' (BCMN). The Hamiltonian for a spherically symmetric scalar field coupled via Einstein's equations to a  that the path length along the shell be the same in both coordinate systems. This gives the relation where r is interpreted as an implicit function of v via (1.4b) and (1.4c). These coordinates are related by the equations To differentiate between the coordinates v, u and the functions of V, U defined by these equations, the latter are designated by v, u and the (functional, not algebraic) inverses of the functions by From equations (1.6) and (1.7) one obtains I also assume the shell  This ensures that an inward-going light ray emitted just as collapse begins cannot bounce off r =0 and escape before the shell has passed through its Schwarzschild radius. These restrictions on the speed of infall of the shell are made for convenience of later mathematics only, and do not affect the conclusions. The time coordinates v. and t inside and outside the shell, respectively, are related by demanding is rapidly collapsing with The coordinates u, U and v, V have been chosen so that the shell begins to collapse at retarded time u = U =0 and at advanced time v = V = 0. In these coordinates the metric (1.1) is given by The shell radius is given by the equation r =R(T), with R(T) given, for example, by the equation Also define the advanced and retarded null ordinates The two-dimensional metric which I will be investigating in this section is the restriction to two dimensions of a collapsing-shell metric: spherically symmetric gravitational field is derived which corrects the results of BCMN. Unfortunately, the Hamiltonian is highly nonlinear and nonpolynomial as well as having a nonlocal Hamiltonian density. As a result, no definite results have been obtained, nor has any real line of attack been found as yet. It is presented only in the hope that a solution of this problem would clarify the black-hole evaporation problem. Units are chosen throughout such that G =8 = c =k (Boltzmann's const) =1. All quantities are therefore dimensionless and are measured in terms of Planck units (Lv-10 cm, tp 10~' sec, Mv-10 ' g, Tv-10+" 'K). In order to minimize use of strange letters, note that the coordinates U, V, u, v are defined independently and differently in Secs. I and II. Note further that in Sec. I the use of a caret designates the symbol as a specified function rather than a variable. I. TWO-DIMENSIONAL COLLAPSE consider the massless scalar and Dirac equations restricted to two dimensions: where the asterisk indicates complex conjugation, and the parentheses around indices indicate symmetrization. For the general solution, the various components of T„, are  The scalar field equation is straightforward. In P is assumed to be a 4-spinor, and the y" are the restriction to two dimensions of the fourdimensional Dirac matrices. The operators ~„ =S/Sx" —I'„are defined so that the Dirac matrices have zero derivatives, as in four dimensions. Both (1.10) and (1.11) are conformally invariant 'g when we conformally with P-(t) and transform the metric g"" 0'g"". As all two-dimensional metrics are conformally flat, this greatly simplifies the solution of Eqs. (1.10) and (1.11). Using U, V or u, v coordinates, the scalar equation simply becomes  The metric (1.1) has a timelike Killing vector outside of the shell where the Killing vector q is given by S/St. The energy current4 can be defined  with solutions In two dimensions, the centrifugal barrier which prevents any particle flow through r = 0 is absent. In order to mimic the effect of such a barrier, I demand that there be no net radial flux at r = 0.  As the flux is proportional to (Q*S Q/Sr —complex conjugate), this may be accomplished by demanding that some linear combination go+pep/sr be zero at r =0. (o, P must be fixed real constants so that this property will be valid for all linear combinations of solutions. ) I have chosen to take p = 0 (i.e. , p = 0) as the appropriate condition at r =0. Any other choice would lead to the same conclusions as does this particular choice. At most they would introduce a phase shift in the outgoing wave when compared to this case. The line r =0 corresponds to U = V+2A, . The requirement that the modes vanish on this line leads to the relation (The prime denotes the derivative of the function with respect to its argument. ) In particular, if one selects f(v) to be a normal Expressing g" in u, v coordinates we find that T„" represents the inward flowing energy current across a u = constant surface, whereas T„" represents the outward-flowing energy current across a v =constant surface. The normal modes therefore have a constant energy flow inward with an equal outward flow before the onset of collapse (u & 0). After the onset of collapse (u &0), the inward flow is still constant but the outward flow of energy decays rapidly, U'(u) going to zero exponentially as u ~. [This can be seen from Eq. (1.8) for U-(R, —2M)(1+ v)/v. ] The solution of the neutrino equations is more complicated. One must first choose a representation for the Dirac matrices. We define the matrices y„, y„, yU, y„as follows:  BLACK-HOLE EVAPORATION The reflection condition at demanding The y and y are two different representations in the two coordinate systems and are related by For jg & 0 this is ldentlcRl to the previous result for scalar fields [e.g. , (1.18)] and is of opposite sign for & & 0.

Using the expansion of 4 and 4 in normal modes (1.32) and the definition of the vacuum IO&, the vacuum expectation value of, &, „ zero everywhere. Such a procedure, however, amounts to little more than assuming the answer one is trying to calculate. A gravitational field could surely lead to vacuum polarization effects From E(ls. (1.18) and (1.31), the neutrino and scalar vacuum expectation values are equal but of opposite sign term by term. Furthermore, (0 K, „IO) is infinite for both neutrinos and scalar particles, the divergence going as &'. One posI  sible method of regularizing the vacuum expectation values is to sum the contributions due to the scalar field and due to the neutrinos. This gives a vacuum expectation for the sum of scalar and neutrino energy-momentum tensors of exactly zero evexywhere. The zero-point oscillation energy for the normal modes of the boson field exactly cancel the energy of the filled negative-energy sea of the fermions. In the four-dimensional black-hole formation proble, this procedure would be expected to cancel only the worst divergences of T„„. However, the Hawking energy flow would be largely eliminated. This suggests that the Hawking energy flow may be a result of the worst divergences in T„„which may disappear when the proper renormalization procedure ls found. The above renormalization procedure is certainly not the only possibility. One could, for example, normal-oxder X„„according to the "in" operators giving an expectation value of exactly  One could also attempt to apply methods such as dimensional 1 egulax'lzatlon, which, how'eve 1, seems to me to be applicable only to the case of almost flat spacetimes or highly symmetrical spacetimes. Black-hole evaporation exists only because of the formation of a horizon, a decidedly nonflat spacetime phenomenon. Another renormalization technique is the subtraction of geometrical counterterms (OIY. „IO). Such subtraction terms occur in the Lagrangian density of the form In an empty background spacetime, however, only the first of these leads to a nonzero subtraction  term (i. e. , X, g, „). It is, furthermore, capable of renormalizing only the trace T of the stress-energy tensor. That this is insufficient to renormalize T„„can be seen by noticing that for a conformally invariant field (e.g. , electromagnetic neutrino) the trace is already zero, whereas the divergences in T00 for example, are as bad as those for massive fields. The attempt by Parker and Fulling' to use these subtraction terms in cosmological spacetimes led to manifestly noncovariant expressions for their renormalized T„„. They achieved covariance by using the subtraction technique to renormalize only and then using BLACK-HOLE EVAPORATION  a formal procedure for regularizing Z~" by associating its divergences with the divergences in the Feynman propagator G(x, x'), or rather in the difference between the ' Feynman propagator and the time-symmetric (-, advanced plus retarded) Green's function. By a technique suggested by Schwinger' for background electromagnetic fields, DeWitt obtains the Feyr. .man propagator as a formal integral solution to the equation  The field operator 4 can be split near infinity  of the geodesic disHere o(x, x') is —, tance separating The solution obtained for A is, however, purely local. For example, if x, x' are both within a flat region of spacetime (e. g. , within a spherical dust shell) a valid solution for n is n = 0. This would then imply that the Feynman propagator is defined purely locally by Eq. (1.38), no matter what has occurred in the spacetime outside of the dust shell, and independent of the motion of the dust shell. The Feynman propagator is, however, a, nonloeal Green's function which cannot be defined by a purely local technique, i. e. , by examining the behavior  x' near each other.  ft seems that Eq. (1.37} must be augmented by global boundary conditions in order to obtain the Feynman propagator as a solution. These global boundary conditions will also imply global conditions on Q which would also be expected to alter the behavior of 0 for small values of s. Further research on this problem is being done. Dewitt has also suggested an alternative to the above method, which is not a priori equivalent, due to the interchange of integration and limit pro- This split is exact in two dimensions, and applies Even in two only near infinity in four dimensions. dimensions, however, one would expect the following results to apply only near infinity. We expand /4(v) near infinity in terms of the ingoing modes /y„= e '"'((27r ~(d ~)'/', with (d&0 so that eedures on a divergent expression. This technique is to evaluate X„. „by separating the points at which the two field operators in g„„are evaluated, and then discarding any terms which depend on the magnitude of the separation for small separations. He has related this also to the adiabatic regularization scheme of Parker and Fulling. ' Application to the full four-dimensional black-hole evaporation process has not yet been made. (See, however, Davies, Fulling, and Unruh" for an application to the two-dimensional collapse. ) A more naive prescription for regularizing the expression for the energy flow out through infinity is given by the following procedure. %'e will be concerned here with the flow of energy through a surface near infinity. A conservedenergy-flow vector operator may be defined by Similarly, 04 is expanded in terms of the modes which behave near. As will be shown [Eq.

The first two terms, however will contribute, and for u„u, & 0, their contribution per unit time will be constant. To show this we need an estimate for P(&o, &u') and o(&d, &u'). By the reality of the scalar equation one finds that o((o, &o') =P(&o, &o')*. From Eq. (1.15) we obtain  (note that v, &0 because of the conditions on v). For the purposes of calculating (0}g„,}0) a long time after the onset of collapse (i.e. , large u) it is sufficient to approximate P(&o, &o ) by (see the Appendix) the Hawking result if one remembex s that in two dimensions the absorption amplitude of the black hole is unity. %6 have neglected terms in our approximation for P(&u, &u') which will produce terms in Z(u„u, ) which die off at large  the in modes I 4„, we find that this operator diffex s from the operatox in which we normal-order the various terms of g„, with respect to the appropriate operators by the c-number field:  This normal-ordering  prescription for deter-  mining the energy flow out through 9+ also has some justification in that the "out" vacuum state }0)o defined by oa }0)o =oh }0)o is a state of min1.6., any imum-enex'gy flow out, thx'ough lnflnlty n-particle "out" state has a higher energy flow The normal-ordering procedure through therefore just subtracts off the expectation value of energy outflow in this state.

As the above process applies to both scalar and neutrino fields we appear to have a contradiction. %hen the neutrino and scalar energy-momentum tensors were summed mode by mode, one obtained zero energy flow in two dimensions into or out of the black hole. Now, however, when one sums neutrino and scalar contributions by this technique, one obtains a net energy flow out through infinity. This contradiction comes about  G. because the expressions with which me are working are not absolutely convergent expressions. By an appropriate grouping of terms in a conditionally convergent series, any result desired may be obtained. In the first case, the neutrino and scala. r terms were summed first mode by mode, and then the total expectation value of the energy-momentum tensor was calculated. That order of summatensor tion guarantees that the energy-momentum will be covariant. In the latter method the procedure is inherently The time development of the mode noneovariant. z l)l„ is a linear combination of out modes op . We are therefore performing the mode summation for (0 IX„„I0) in two different ways for the ingoing and outgoing portions of X„, . Although both orders seem natural for their respective parts of g», I mould suggest that such a smitch is invalid. Qnce an order of mode summation in calculating X„, is used in one part of spacetime, I would suggest it must be used everywhere. Qtherwise, by an appropriate choice of order of summation of 'he modes, one could arrive at any answer one wanted. ~3 If this is eorreet,  then the procedure of FermiBose cancellation, in which the mode sum is defined so as to result in no inflow of energy into the black hole„suggests that there is also no outflow  of energy from the black hole and that the quantum  HAWKING PROCESS FOR ETERNAL BLACK HOLES  The procedure in this section mas inspired by a study begun by Fulling' *" on alternative quantizaIn particular, the natural tions of flat spacetime quantization in Rindler coordinates leads to a quantization inequivalent to the normal Minkowski The resolution of the problem there quantization. leads directly to a quantization of the full Schwarzschild spacetime which has all of the features that Hawking found for a black hole formed by collapse of a star. As the collapse is replaced by certain natural boundary conditions on the past horizon of the black hole, this problem is mathematically much simpler than the collapse proble m. I will first discuss the Rindler-Minkowski situation for a, massive scalar field before going on to the Schwarzsehild case. Writing flat spacetimes in Rindler" coordinates leads to the metric  The nor mal-mode solutions Minkowski coordinates are  to this equation in Qne can define a second quantization by forming the other hand, one ean define normal modes in the Hindler system where g(p) satisfies the equation The Fulling-Rindler  vacuum is defined by  What is the relationship between these two systems of quantization T To begin with, me also define a complete set of functions in the other half Rindler space (p&0 and z& —~t~). Designating this side by A and the other half by g' we can write These modes are complete in the region of that spacetime covered by the Rindler coordinate system (i.e., p&0and z& ~f ~). We can expand 4 in terms of this basis in this half of spacetime:  By a suitable choice of phase, n is a constant of unit modulus. Along the surface v = -~, V = 0, the past horizon of the Rindler coordinates, we obtain  FIG. 1. The various regions of Minkowski in Rindler accelerated coordinates.  spacetime  is functionally equal to  where p, 7 are taken as lying in their respective half spaces. The choice of which operators to treat as creation operators and which as annihilation operators is forced on us by the commutation relations obeyed by these operators. The functions „+P-~ and ~-P ~ can be analytically extended across the future and past horizons (t =+z) into the regions F (i.e., t & z ) ) and P (t& -~z) ) of Minkowski spacetime (see Fig. 1), such that ~+/ are zero only in the region R and „(II) are zero only in R'. The expansion of Eq. (2.12) is then valid in the full Minkowski spacetime. (This follows from the fact that the union of the two spacelike hypersurfaces given by 7 =0 in both R' and R is a Cauchy surface for the full Minkowski spacetime. ) I will now show that the second quantization defined by this expansion of 4 is not equivalent to the usual Minkowski second quantization, and will find a linear combination of the ~+a and ~ a operators which are annihilation operators of the usual Minkowski second quantization. Finding the relationship between this expansion and the more normal Minkowski expansion of 4 is equivalent to finding the relationship between the positive-frequency spaces defined by w &0 and (d &0. This is most easily found by going to the null hypersurface p =0 or t = —z. Define the null coordinates  (I have dropped the e ' " term, a procedure which can be justified by constructing wave packets. ) A positive-frequency Minkowski mode on this surface becomes i An important  point to note is that for all values of k„positive or negative, and vice versa for id&0, i.e. , sign(++0, ) =sign(e). The positive-frequency (d Minkowski modes are therefore characterized by the condition that they are analytic and bounded in the lower half complex U plane [Im(U)&0] on V =0. Similarly, note that the combination which is the restriction to real U of a function analytic in the entire lower half complex U plane. ~P- is therefore a positive-frequency function in the Minkowski sense for all values of (d, positive and negative. The expression (2w)'id2 sinh(2w 2)) '~' has been chosen to normalize „P- under the usual scalar inner product. Note that for positive 9, the function ~P- is almost entirely concentrated in the R' region, whereas for u&0 it is concentrated in the R as the Rindler region. This is understandable,  is a function which increases with time t in but decreases with t in A . The positive-frequency Rindler mode would be expected to be an almost positive-frequency Minkowski mode in R' but almost negative-frequency Minkowski mode in as is actually found to be the case. Also note in passing that the probability that a positive-frequency Rindler function „+P- is in a negative-frequency Minkowski state is just spacetime can be obtained. The Minkowski vacuum state can be reexpressed as a many-particle Fulling-Rindler (FR) state. By comparing the expansion of 4 in terms of the Minkowski positive-frequency basis of Eq. (2.17), and comparing the resultant creation and annihilation operator with the FR set of (2.12) one obtains The massless scalar wave equation is given by solutions to this may be written This has two solutions, one representing waves incoming from infinity, and one representing waves coming out of the past horizon of the black hole. These solutions are designated by 'f and f, respective The standard naive prescription for defining the positive-frequency states in this case is to define 0 states as the positive-frequency states. the This prescription I shall call the g definition, as it is related to the timelike Killing vector q = S/St. I.e. , one defines positive frequency via the modes which are eigenfunctions of the Lie derivative of the scalar field in the g direction. On the other hand, the Schwarzschild metric (and all the black-hole metrics) has another vector field $ which is of Killing type on the past horizon,  which is exactly the Boltzmann factor for a Bose gas with temperature 1/4w. From this, the analysis of Davies" on the Hawking process in flat where Z is a normalization constant. In the next section we shall find that an accelerated detector will respond to the presence of these FR particles in the Minkowski vacuum. But what has this digression to do with black holes? A similar analysis is possible for an Schwarzschild black hole. For the virtual states of a quantum field which emanate from the past horizon of a black hole, two possible Foch quantization are also possible, corresponding exactly to the FR-Minkowski possibilities in flat spacetime. I will take the Schwarzschild metric as the example, but any other black-hole metric would also do as well. By going through the analysis I shall describe, one readily obtains the HawkingGibbons" results for charged- rotating-black- hole evaporation. In fact, this technique was noticed by me before I was aware of the original published Hawking result. It was only after becoming aware of Hawking's result, however, that I realized that this mathematical procedure had physical significance and was related to the question of blackhole evaporation. Killing vector on Furthermore, the integral curves of (, unlike those of g, are geodesics on H . If we define normal modes such that on H they are eigenfunctions of the Lie derivative with respect to (,  As in the flat-spacetime Rindler case, the horizon divides the spacetime into two separate exterior spacetimes. Outgoing q modes can again be defined in both halves of the spacetime. These I. e. , will be designated by + or —presubscripts.   for t, r located in the right exterior spacetime and zero in the left exterior region, and similarly for p„which is zero in the right exterior region. Then the outgoing mode  is positive frequency in the $ sense for all values e. I.e. , either this set, or the set of Eq. (2.27) for e & 0 are a complete set of $ positive-freof  quency waves.  There are a number of reasons why I favor the definition over the q definition for positive frequency for modes emanating from the past horizon of the Schwarzschild black hole. Firstly, the next section will indicate that a particle detector freely falling near the future horizon will respond to the presence of f, not g, positive-frequency modes i. e. , these $ frequency modes are, to my mind, the best definition of what one would mean in saying a particle is coming out of the past horizon of the black hole. Secondly, if one examines the stellar collapse	This paper examines various aspects of black-hole evaporation. A two-dimensional model is investigated where it is shown that using fermion-boson cancellation on the stress-energy tensor reduces the energy outflow to zero, while other noncovariant techniques give the Hawking result. A technique for replacing the collapse by boundary conditions on the past horizon is developed which retains the essential features of the collapse while eliminating some of the difficulties. This set of boundary conditions is also suggested as the most natural set for a preexistent black hole, The behavior of particle detectors under acceleration is investigated where it is shown that an accelerated detector even in flat spacetime will detect particles in the vacuum. The similarity of this case with the behavior of a detector near the black hole is brought out, and it is shown that a geodesic detector near the horizon will not see the Hawking flux of particles. Finally, the work of Berger, Chitre, Nutku, and Moncrief on scalar geons is corrected, and the spherically symmetric coupled scalar-gravitation Hamiltonian is presented in the hope that someone can apply it to the problem of black-hole evaporation.	W. G. Unruh
22	Paper15	1976	Notes on black-hole evaporation	does not. As most physical properties of the scalar field (e.g. , charge density, energy, etc. ) involve derivatives, this suggests that the physics under the q definition becomes singular there, even if the propagator itself does not increase without bound.  Fourthly, the (definition of positive frequency is invariant under ordinary time translation, as can be seen from Eq. (1.29). Furthermore, it is also invariant under the additional symmetry of U translation along the past horizon. Under the condition that the vacuum state should be invariant under the largest symmetry group available, the ( definition for modes leaving H would be the preferred definition. (In flat spacetime it is the property that the Minkowski definition of positive frequency is invariant under the full Poincare group, whereas the Rindler definition is not, that singles it out as the preferred quantization. ) To summarize, positive frequency for those states which enter the exterior Schwarzschild spacetime through H, the past horizon of the black hole, is defined via, the Killing vector ( on H . For those states which originate at infinity, however, the usual q definition will be used. On the q definition ha, s all of the advantages that the $ definition has on H . the field 4 in the exterior In second-quantizing of the Schwarzschild black hole we expand it as follows (neglecting terms equal to zero there):  inside of the star just as it is about to cross its horizon, and which was a positive-frequency mode when it came toward the star from infinity, will be a $ positive-frequency mode as it leaves the star. In this sense, the ( definition of positive frequency does correspond to replacing the collapse process by boundary conditions on H . Thirdly, as I shall soon indicate, the Feynman propagator obtained from the q-definition of positive frequency has singular physical (i.e. , not related to coordinate singularities) derivatives on the future horizon whereas that using the $ definition Alternately, the second part could have been exmodes of Eq. (2. 29). panded in terms of the In the exterior region of the Schwarzschild spacetime this becomes  when it exits from the collapsing star (n is a positive constant depending on the details of the collapse). This equation is obtained from Eqs. (1.8) and (1.15). I. e. , a mode which emerges from the  unambiguous G(x, x') for incomplete spacetimes. We go to Rindler spacetime for the example. For two points x, x' both within one half of the Rindler spacetime, we can solve Eq. (2.34) by  time t runs backward there. The vacuum state ~0)„associated with this expansion is given by vacuum, infinite number of pairs of particles. As has been suggested by Hawking, these particles occur in pairs, one particle in the right-hand exterior region and the other on the other side of the horizon. (In the context of the collapse situation, Wald' has come to a similar conclusion. ) By inserting the metric between the two past horizons of the Kruskal extension of the Schwarzschild metric, one finds that the $ definition of positive frequency is exactly the definition one would naturally use for this interior metric. By this trick one can also see that the $ definition of positive frequency can be made symmetric for both exterior regions of the Kruskal extension of spacetime. In the previous definition, I defined positive frequency along the V= 0 hypersurface, which is the past horizon for the one exterior region but becomes the future horizon for the other. The above trick shows that procedure is not the only possible one, and that positive frequency could equally well have been defined over the past horizon of both extensions. In the one exterior region of concern to us, the change will make no difference. Let us now briefly examine the Feynman propagator G(x, x'). One could try to define it using De&itt's suggestions of writing the equation  Performing the (d integration first one obtains not the usual Minkowski Feynman propagator, but the Rllldlel plopRgRtol. (l.e. , tile plopagatol. takes Rindler, not Minkowski positive frequencies forward in time). This again demonstrates that in addition to Eq. (2.34) one needs boundary conditions on G(x, x') as the two points become widely separated and on the horizon at p= 0, t = + ~ to obtain the correct propagator. [As Boulware'0 has shown, if one does supply the correct boundary conditions in the fully extended Rindler metric (i.e. , full Minkowski spacetime), the usual propagator is obtained. ] The Feynman propagator may be defined as where T(. . . ) designates the time-ordered product This equation immediately leads to an alternative method of finding the Feynman propagator. Regard x' as fixed. Let G„(x,x') be the advanced Green's function for the field (which is invariantly defined). Take the point x back to the hypersurface on which one has defined what one means by positive frequencies. (E.g. , 8 or the past horizon. ) Subtract from G„(x,x') a free positive-frequency wave exactly equal to the positive-frequency component of G„(x,x') on the hypersurface. This sum is then the Feynman propagator. I would like to briefly compare the behavior of the Feynman propagators obtained by using the E definition and the q definition of positive frequency. Take the point x of the advanced Green's function G„(x,x') to lie on either 8 or H, the pa. st horizon. As positive frequency for a wave on 8 is defined in the same way for both g and $ definitions, only the behavior on H, the past horizon, will cause any difference. The projection kernel K(x, x) for positive q frequencies on H can be given by  where both I, u lie on the lower half (U&0) of H . The I) positive-frequency component of G„(x,x') on H is then given by the other hand, the projection kernel for positive frequency is given by  (b} The process of detection of a field quanta by a detector, defined as the exciting of the detector by the field, may correspond to either the absorption or the emission of a field quanta when the de~ec~or is a accelerated one. Both of these results, although surprising at  first glance, are, using hindsight, Note that P„(G(x, x')) will have a cusp at U= 0. Although P, (G(x, x'}) goes to zero as U-0 (i.e. ,  as x approaches the future horizon), the first derivative of P„(G„(x,x')) diverges as [U(lnU)'] ' as U~ 0. Since U ls a well-deflQed null cool dlQate  near the horizon, this implies that the gradient of G„(x,x'}, the Feynman propagator in the q system, will diverge as the future horizon U=0 is approached. Boulware'0 has also examined the Feynman propagator in the full extended Kruskal metric. He arrived at the q definition for his propagator. This result was, however, obtained because his definition of particles coming out of the past horizon depended on an implicit use of the q definition of positive f requency. The singularity in the Feynman propagator on the future horizon when the g definition is used is nonphysical. Such a singularity would locally single out the horizon, whereas the spacetime structure and casual structure of the future horizon gives no reason why it should be singled out. III. PARTICLE DETECTORS  This section wiQ examine the behavior of particle detectors under accelerated states of motion of the detector. The main conclusions I will draw will be the following: (a) A particle detector will react to states which have positive frequency with respect to the detectors proper time, not with respect to any universal time.  very reasonable, but they make the generalization of what is meant by a vacuum state to a nonflat spacetime extremely difficult. The model detectors I will investigate are of two types. One is a box, containing a Schrodinger particle in its ground state. The detector is said to have detected a quanta of the massless scalax field 4, if the detector is found in a state other than its ground state at some time. The other model is a fully relativistic one. Here I assume that the detector, described by the scalar field 4' with mass p. is coupled via the field 4 to an "excited" state described by the scalar field to cp with mass M & p, . Both 4' and y are assumed be complex fields, but for simplicity 4 is taken to be a real field. The detector is said to have detected a 4 quanta if the detector is found in the excited state p at some time. This detector could be further complicated by coupling y back to 4' via some "dial" fields (representing states of a computer memory, or readings on an instrument dial} but we shall leave it in its most primitive form. I et us examine a box detector being uniformly accelerated. The simplest way to treat this system is to go to a Rindler coordinate system, in which the box is at rest at p coordinate p„and at x =y =0. The equation of the particle in the box is given by  where g = (p- p0)/V p, is the proper length coordinate in the p direction, and Mp, 7. is the proper time. I have assumed that g is small everywhere within the box. This equation is just the Schrodinger equation for a particle in a potential mf/2v/10 s V p0 =1/213, with a the acceleration of the box, this is exactly the expected result. The eigenfunctions of the right-hand side of (3.1b) will be denoted by t}t,. with eigenvalue E, The lowest state will have =O. The r dependence of /twill therefore be exp(-iE, .

Performing the integral over the time first and remembering that P,. has a time dependence of the form e '~~'~" we obtain Evaluating ship that  The first factor represents the destruction of one of the Rindler particles which exist in the state ~0)~ by the detector in the detection process. The second factor represents the sensitivity of the detector to a FR mode of frequency ~, Note that if (}'3,2+)'322) & (E, —E,)', „(p) falls to zero rapidly, as can be seen from Eq. (2.9). One can evaluate the term (p z, a„-3 ~0) by rewriting ~, a„-~ in terms of the Minkowski creation  To evaluate this expression one needs an estimate for Although an exact solution may be found in terms of Hankel functions, it is sufficient (and more transparent} to use a WKB approximation in solving Eq. (2. 9) for p near p, . For o/, '&(k, '+k, ')p„ the solution will be essentially zero owing to the boundary conditions as p goes to infinity. For o//') (k, '+k, ')po, we obtain spacetime therefore becomes very difficult. Before going on to this problem, however, let us continue examining the accelerated detector in flat spacetime. We note that the state (p in which the C field is left by the detection process is a state with fewer FR particles than the 0)„state. On the other hand, the (p state is a one-particle state as far as the usual Minkowski observer is concerned. He sees the detector jumping up to its excited state g, by emission of a C quantum, not by absorption. What the detector regards as the detection (and thus absorption) of a 4 quantum, the Minkowski observer sees as the emission by the detector of such a quantum. The energy for this emission, as far as the Minkowski observer is concerned, comes from the external field accelerating the detector. However, it is not this external field which couples the ground state g, to the excited state g&. If & =0, the detector stays forever in the state P, . These results are independent of the means used to accelerate the detector, but depend only on the acceleration itself. It is the field C which is producing the excitation of the accelerated detector. This process is not simply the result of our semiclassical model for the detector. The fully relativistic model for a detector mentioned at the beginning of this section displays the same pheI v3 is the velocity in the p direction of the wave as measured by physical coordinates, and 5 is a phase  depending on a&. Defining the detector cross section for a plane wave with wave numbers ky k2 k3 ln flat spacetime by I have assumed a sufficient line width for the detector so that the detector will average over the phase 5 of Eq. (3.8). This result is exactly what one would expect of a detector immersed in a thermal bath of scalar photons of temperature a/2x. The essential reason for this result is that the detector measures frequencies with respect to its own proper time. For an accelerated observer, this definition of positive frequency is not equivalant to that of a nonaccelerated observer. In flat spacetime, positive frequency defined with respect to any geodesic detector is equivalent to that of any other geodesic detector. One can therefore demand that any flat spacetime detector be a geodesic detector, and no contradictions will arise. However, the generalization of this to a nonflat spacetime results in the possibility that two equally valid geodesic detectors will disagree on whether there are field quanta present. What to one is a vacuum state, to the other will be a many-particle state, and vice versa. The generalization of the concept of particles in a nonflat  nomena. The detector 4, its excited state y, and the field 4 are assumed to obey equations of motion derived from an action of the form  The mass of the detector, p, , can be taken to be very large (e.g. , kilograms for a bubble chamber) and (M —p) may be very small. Note that in the absence of the coupling with the 4 field (i.e. , e =0) a q particle will never spontaneously become a p particle Similarly, in flat spacetime, where 4' does not interact with any external field (i.e. , is unaccelerated) and where 4 is in its vacuum state, no transition from 4 to y ever occurs. The presence of a 4 quantum could however produce such a transition which one would regard as the detection of that quantum. If we now accelerate the detector field 4', for example by an external electromagnetic field, one can have a transition to a y state, even when the C field is initially in the vacuum state. Regarding 4, y, 4 as quantum operators, we  and similar equations for the y and 4 states.

The probability that this state will be transformed to the final state I would now like to return to the question of particle detectors in a curved spacetime. In flat spacetime one could say that the only valid detectors are geodesic detectors, detectors unaccelerated by any external forces. One would nom like to apply the same reasoning to a curved spacetime. However, one immediately runs into trouble. As mentioned before, not all geodesics are equivalent in a curved spacetime. The simplest example of this problem is to consider three detectors near a massive body. One detector is fixed at constant radius r, the other two detectors are orbiting the mass in a circular orbit of radius y', but in opposite directions. Consider the modes of the 4 field. They may be written as  mith the detector in its excited state cp„will be given by the standard reduction formulas":  The third line on the right-hand side comes from keeping only the lowest-order terra in e for 4 and y, If all three of p, P, P are free field modes, this integral will be zero {the conservation of both energy and momentum prevent the decay of a lowermass 4 particle into a higher-mass rp particle plus a 4 quantum). However, if the modes g, and y„are modes under the influence of some background field, this integral need no longer be equal to zero. Although a Minkowski observer will say that the accelerated 4 particle has emitted a 4 quantum and gone to the excited state cp, with the external field supplying the necessary energy and momentum, one could equally interpret this as the detection of a 4 quantum by the accelerated 4 detector. A well-known example of such a process is the formation of a neutron by the inverse beta decay of a proton under the influence of strong or elec-  For the fixed detector at constant r, a positive frequency mode is one for which e&0.

Answering this question is, of course, the key problem in understanding the effects of matter quantization on the gravitational field. Applying these results on particle detectors to the black-hole evaporation problem, one finds that for a detector stationed near the horizon of the black hole, the transition probability of the detector per unit time can be calculated in a similar may to that for a static detector in Rindler coordinates. Assume that the detector is placed at a radius x=R very near the horizon of the black hole. The  collapse by boundary conditions on the past horizon, and proceeding exactly as for the flat-spacetime accelerated detector, one finally obtains a transition rate per unit proper time: 2 (r) is the outgoing radial function defined in (2.2 ) and (2.24). Again we use a %KB approximation to solve Eq. (2.23). Definiting a proper radius coordinate by  where the + refers to outgoing or ingoing waves, respectively.

Note that the temperature and number of detectable particles diverge as R -2M in precisely the same way as for an accelerating detector in flat spacetime. In both cases the temperature diverges as a/2w. The number of particles seen by a freely falling  detector is much more difficult to calculate. If the detector is far from the horizon, its motion toward the black hole would be expected to lead to particle detection. Furthermore, near the horizon, the detector has a lifetime of only of the order of M and cannot, therefore, measure particles less energetic than that. However, the particles seen by the static detector have energies of the order of a=(R —2M) '. Furthermore, if they were real particles, the Doppler shift from the static frame to the freely falling frame would increase this energy for those particles which seem to be coming out of the black hole from the viewpoint of the static observer. If they were real, these particles should present no difficulty in observation to the freely falling observer. Near the horizon, the Schwarzschild metric can be approximated by  The geodesics near the horizon are essentially the geodesics of this cylindrical metric, and the positive frequencies seen by the geodesic detectors are essentially the positive frequencies with respect to 7. of this metric. We can attach this metric to the inside of the black hole at the horizon, in order to eliminate the singularities within the black hole. As the Hawking process is insensitive to what goes on within the black hole, this procedure should not alter the Hawking process. The main purpose in doing so is to ease the analysis of the response of a geodesic detector near the black hole. On the past horizon of the black hole we have already decided that the $ definition of positive frequency is the most appropriate. Similarly, near the future horizon, the definition using the vector field 8/BV= $', which is of Killing type, on the future horizon will correspond to positive frequency in the sense naturally associated with the cylindrical metric (3.19' and thus also with a geodesic particle detector near the horizon. The definition of positive frequency for staces coming out of the past horizon makes them also of positive frequency in the metric of (3.19), and a geodesic detector will therefore see no particles coming out of the black hole. However, when these states reflect off the curvature of the Schwarzschild exterior the positive-frequency states will components in the sense pick up negative-frequency of this cylindrical metric (the $' sense) and, similarly, the states coming in from infinity which are positive frequency at infinity will have negative-frequency components in the $' sense. This implies that a geodesic detector near the horizon will see particles flowing into the black hole (i.e. , will be excited by states which are coming from the exterior region). The geodesic detector therefore sees no outflow of particles, but does see an influx of particles into the black hole. The key question is: Which of these definitions, if any, corresponds to what the gravitational field sees as particles, i.e. , as carriers of energy and momentum? If one accepts the "geodesic" particles, both near the horizon and at infinity, as the true particles, one obtains the paradoxical situation that particles both flow into the horizon and out through infinity i.e. , the "black hole" increases in area, and loses mass to infinity. The  —  14  only place where the "energy" for such a process could originate would be in the vacuum polarization of the field in the region outside the black  hole. In this context it would be of interest to push the fermion-boson cancellation scheme of Sec. I, or some other renormalization technique for the energy-momentum tensor, to four dimensions to examine the behavior of the energy-momentum tensor near the black hole. IV. SPHERICALLY SYMMETRIC SCALAR MINISUPERSP ACE  As a beginning of another approach to this problem, the Hamiltonian for a spherically symmetric scalar field coupled to the gravitational field is presented. This work is basically a correction of that done by Berger, Chitre, Nutku, and Moncrief. Berger ef al. (hereafter referred to as BCNM) formalism used the ADM (Arnowitt-Deser-Misner) to derive a Hamiltonian for the coupled scalar gravitational fields under the restriction of spherical symmetry. Using spatial coordinates adapted to the spherical symmetry (i.e. , the usual 8, P coordinates on a sphere), they chose the radial coordinate r such that the area of the sphere of constant t, r has area 4nr'. Under these restrictions, the ADM The equations which result from variation of the action, Eq. (4.2), with respect to N„w„p, , vo, C respectively areOne still has one final coordinate condition to choose. We choose the parameter t such that m„=0 at all times. In particular, if t is a coordinate such that m„40, one can make a coordinate change such that v„=0. From Eq. (4.6) we see that m„=0 is equivalent to choosing t such that  Where 1 —v„'/16r' is zero, t is a null coordinate, and that surface is a null surface. Equation (4.13), together with the boundary condition that will completely specify (Note that the only condition on N0, and e" necessary to satisfy the as boundary condition is that ~, and that N, e approach a constant. ) These equations are different from those stated by BCNM and those found by Kuchar for cylindrical waves. '4 The presence of the factor N~" in (4.7c) prevents us from using the Kuchar transformation here. Let us assume the spacetime is such that the transformation m„=0 everywhere is possible. Choosing N0 so 'that N0 1 at r = ~ and such that Eq. (4.7c) is satisfied, one finds Equation (4. 7b) is automatically satisfied because of the Bianchi identities. With these solutions for N, p, , Eqs. (4.7d) and (4.7e) may both be derived from the Hamiltonian  This Hamiltonian differs considerably from the BCNM result. An examination of their result, however, shows that their reduced Hamiltonian does not reproduce Eqs. (4.7). The reason for this difference is instructive. After solving (4.7a) for p, , a variation of xo and 4 will lead to a nonzero variation of p. on the This leads boundary of the region of integration. to nonzero boundary terms when the action is varied, with respect to no or C. Compensating for these boundary terms leads to the Hamiltonian leads to  where the prime denotes the var iation with p, regarded as an independent function, and 5p. is the variation in p. caused by a variation of m~. Expression (4.21) becomes  The first term is exactly the expression one obtains by varying the original action (4.2) with respect to n~. The latter term is essentially the term one obtains by varying the original action with respect to p, except that, now it does not vanish on the boundary. The nonboundary terms of N, 5'8'/5' p are equal to ir, and-thus are zero. The boundary terms, however, are given by The first factor in the integrand is just the flatspacetime Hamiltonian density for the scalar field. Furthermore, one finds that K is just equal to the gravitational mass as measured at infinity; i.e. , near infinity goo 1 —2K/K. In quantizing the Hamiltonian (4.19), the fields m~, C are interpreted as conjugate fields obeying the usual commutation relations  Finding solutions for this problem is, however, extremely difficult. For the unquantized fields, it is obvious that C =0, m~ =0 represents a minimum for X, corresponding to flat spacetime. No proof has been found to demonstrate that flat spacetime ((K) =0) represents the quantum-mechanical minimum expectation value, however. If flat spacetime were a solution to this quantum problem, one could, for example, form a quantum wave packet at infinity representing a collapsing shell of scalar "photons. One could then calculate whether there was any possibility of forming a black hole, or whether any structure formed by such a collapse always eventually evaporated. Classically, Christodoulou" has shown that a collapsing scalar "photon*' cloud can form a black hole. The absence of such a possibility in the quantum regime would indicate that the Hawking process is a realistic possibility. Unfortunately, no progress has as yet been made on this approach and I present it here in the hope that someone else may be able to do something   where K is given by (4.19). In order that the action (4.2) give the same equations after solving and substituting for p, , one must add a term JKdt to the action to cancel out the boundary terms produced by the boundary variation of p. This leads to (4. 19) as the Hamiltonian density. The importance of such boundary terms has also been analyzed by Regge and Teitelboim. The Hamiltonian (4.19) may be rewritten by an integration by parts as  There are many people I have greatly benefitted from in this work. In particular, I would like to thank S. Hawking, G. Gibbons, and B. DeWitt for helpful conversations, the relativity group at Princeton for inviting me to give a talk which was the impetus for my examination of accelerated detectors, C. Misner for pointing out the BCNM paper to me, and V. Moncrief for helping me to understand the ABM formalism. I would also like to thank the Miller Foondation of the University of California for generous support while part of this work was being done and the Department of Physics, Princeton University, where some of the preparation of the manuscript was done.

23	Paper16	2018	Black hole entropy and soft hair	Published for SISSA by  Springer  Received: November 26, 2018 Accepted: December 5, 2018 Published: December 17, 2018  Black hole entropy and soft hair  Abstract: A set of infinitesimal Virasoro L ⊗ Virasoro R diffeomorphisms are presented which act non-trivially on the horizon of a generic Kerr black hole with spin J. The covariant phase space formalism provides a formula for the Virasoro charges as surface integrals on the horizon. Integrability and associativity of the charge algebra are shown to require the inclusion of ‘Wald-Zoupas’ counterterms. A counterterm satisfying the known consistency requirement is constructed and yields central charges cL = cR = 12J. Assuming the existence of a quantum Hilbert space on which these charges generate the symmetries, as well as the applicability of the Cardy formula, the central charges reproduce the macroscopic area-entropy law for generic Kerr black holes. Keywords: Black Holes, Gauge-gravity correspondence, Space-Time Symmetries ArXiv ePrint: 1810.01847 We are deeply saddened to lose our much-loved friend and collaborator Stephen Hawking whose contributions to black hole physics remained vitally stimulating to the very end. This paper summarizes the status of our long-term project on large diffeomorphisms, soft hair and the quantum structure of black holes until the end of our time together. 2 Hidden conformal symmetry 3 Conformal coordinates 4 Conformal vector fields 5 Covariant charges 6 Left movers 7 The area law 8 Discussion A Construction of covariant charges 1 Introduction  Many supersymmetric or near-supersymmetric black holes in string theory admit a Vir L ⊗ Vir R action of nontrivial or ‘large’ diffeomorphisms [1, 2] (henceforth large diffeos) whose central charge can be determined by the analysis of Brown and Henneaux [3]. This fact, along with a few modest assumptions, allow one to determine the microscopic entropy of the black hole and reproduce [4] the macroscopic area law [5] without reliance on stringy microphysics. More recently, the effects of large diffeos on physically realistic black holes have been studied from a different point of view [6–42], beginning from the observation of Bondi, Metzner, van der Burg and Sachs [43, 44] that they can act nontrivially on the boundary of spacetime at infinity. This paper initiates a synthesis of these approaches, and provides motivating evidence for the conjecture that the entropy of real-world Kerr black holes can be understood in a manner similar to their mathematically much better understood stringy counterparts. The large diffeos in stringy examples are not ordinarily taken to act on the entire asymptotically flat spacetime. Roughly speaking, the spacetime is divided into two pieces. One piece contains the black hole and the other asymptotically flat piece has an inner boundary surrounding a hole. The large diffeos are taken to act on the black hole. The dividing surface is often taken to be the the ‘outer boundary’ of a decoupled near-horizon AdS3 region, and the large diffeos are taken to act on this region. However, there is some  ambiguity in the choice of dividing surface, and with a suitable extension inward, the large diffeos can alternately be viewed as acting on the horizon. Indeed, when the black hole is embedded in an asymptotically flat spacetime there is no clear location to place the outer boundary of the AdS3 region, and the horizon itself provides a natural dividing surface. Using the covariant phase space formalism [45–51] (see also the cogent recent review [52]) with a surface term reproduces the standard entropy results for BTZ black holes in AdS 3 from an intrinsically horizon viewpoint, albeit with a slight shift in interpretation. Further comments on this division of the spacetime, and the corresponding split of the Hilbert space into two pieces, appear in the concluding section. Using the horizon itself as the dividing surface permits the analysis of a more general class of black holes without near-horizon decoupling regions, such as most of those seen in the sky. It was recently shown [6, 7] that supertranslations act non-trivially on a generic black hole, changing both its classical charges and quantum state i.e. generating soft hair. However, supertranslations form an abelian group and are clearly inadequate for an inference of the entropy along the lines of the stringy analysis. As emphasized in [6, 7, 17, 26] a richer type of soft hair, as in the stringy examples, associated to nonabelian large diffeos, is needed. In this paper we consider a more general class of Vir L ⊗ Vir R diffeos of a generic spin J Kerr black hole, inspired by the discovery some years ago [53] of a ‘hidden conformal symmetry’ which acts on solutions of the the wave equation in Kerr in a near-horizon region of phase space rather than spacetime. In [53] and subsequent work e.g. [54–68] the numerological observation was made that, if one assumes the black hole Hilbert space is a unitary two-dimensional CFT with cR = cL = 12J, the Cardy formula reproduces the entropy. Here we bring this enticing numerological observation two steps closer to an actual explanation of the entropy. First we give precise meaning to the hidden conformal symmetry in the form of an explicit set of Vir L ⊗ Vir R vector fields which generate it and moreover act non-trivially on the horizon in the sense that their boundary charges are non-vanishing. Secondly, within the covariant formalism, we seek and find a Wald-Zoupas boundary counterterm which removes certain obstructions to the existence of a well-defined charge and gives cL = cR = 12J. We do not herein prove uniqueness of the counterterm, attempt to tackle the difficult problem of characterizing ‘all’ diffeos which act non-trivially on the black hole horizon, or show that the charges defined are integrable or actually generate the associated symmetries via Dirac brackets. These tasks are left to future investigations. For these reasons our work might be regarded as incremental evidence for, but certainly not a demonstration of, the hypothesis that hidden conformal symmetry explains the leading black hole microstate degeneracy. Previous potentially related attempts to obtain 4D black hole entropy from a Virasoro action at the horizon include [19, 42, 69–75]. This paper is organized as follows. In section 2 we review prior work on hidden conformal symmetry. Section 3 presents conformal coordinates in which the Virasoro action takes the simple form presented in section 4. In sections 5 and 6 we compute the covariant rightmoving Iyer-Wald Virasoro charges and identify an obstruction related to the holographic  gravitational anomaly of [76] to their associative and integrable action. A Wald-Zoupas counterterm which eliminates the obstruction is found and the central terms computed. In section 7 we show, assuming the validity of the Cardy formula, that the microscopic degeneracies reproduce the area law. Section 8 concludes with a general argument that all information about microstates of a generic black hole, transforming under a Virasoro generated by a large diffeo, is contained in the quantum state outside the horizon. Throughout this paper we use units such that c = ~ = k = G = 1.  , is the location of the outer horizon. This simply states that the soft mode wavelength is large compared to the black hole. One way to see the emergent symmetry is from the fact that the explicit near-horizon wave functions of soft modes are hypergeometric functions of r, and therefore fall into representations of SL(2, R). In fact, the scalar wave equation for angular momentum ` can be written in this region [53] as the formula for the Casimir either of an SL(2, R)L or an SL(2, R)R , with conformal weights with (ω, m) the soft mode energy and axial component of angular momentum. The left/right temperatures and entropies are thermodynamically conjugate, as follows from  Kerr black holes with generic mass M and spin J ≤ M 2 exhibit a hidden conformal symmetry which acts on low-lying soft modes [53]. The symmetry emerges, not in a nearhorizon region of spacetime, but in the near-horizon region of phase space defined by is precisely the well known formula for the absorption cross section of an energy (ωL , ωR ) excitation of a 2D CFT at temperatures (TL , TR ). This motivates the hypothesis that the black hole is itself a thermal 2D CFT and transforms under a Vir L ⊗ Vir R action. Motivated by this, in the spirit of [6, 7], in section 4 below we explicitly realize the hidden conformal symmetry in the form of Vir L ⊗ Vir R diffeos which act non-trivially on the black hole horizon.2 We begin by recalling the coordinate transformation [53] which most clearly exhibits the conformal structure. Conformal coordinates are [53]3 The past horizon is at w+ = 0, the future horizon at w− = 0 and the bifurcation surface We wish to note however that there may also exist, as in the Kerr/CFT [74] context, an alternate holographic formulation with a left Virasoro-Kac-Moody symmetry, where the Kac-Moody zero mode generates right-moving translations [77], which surprisingly in some cases provides an alternate explanation for example of formulae like (2.3). Indeed with the exciting recent progress in understanding the underlying warped conformal field theories [78–80] this latter possibility is looking the more plausible for the case of Kerr/CFT. Investigation of hidden Virasoro-Kac-Moody symmetries for generic black holes is left to future work.This is the same as the identification which turns AdS3 in Poincaré coordinates into BTZ with temperatures (TL , TR ) where the w± plane becomes thermal Rindler space [81]. It is for this reason that conformal coordinates are well-adapted to an analysis of 4D black holes mirroring that of the 3D BTZ black holes. To leading and subleading order around the bifurcation surface, the metric becomes  Eqs. (4.3), (4.6) are the same restrictions encountered in the quotient of planar AdS3 to BTZ, or 2D Minkowski to thermal Rindler [81]. They imply that the ζn (ζ̄n ) are periodic in imaginary right (left) ‘Rindler time’ 2π ln w+ (2π ln w− ) with period 2πTR (2πTL ) as in (4.3).  Note that the Vir L ⊗ Vir R action maps the ‘θ-leaves’ of fixed polar angle to themselves. ζ preserves the future horizon and ζ̄ the past horizon. The Frolov-Thorne vacuum density matrix for a Kerr black hole is (up to normalization) are the Hawking temperature and angular velocity of the horizon, with ω and m being interpreted here as energy and angular momentum operators. Rewriting this in terms of the eigenvalues of the zero modes ζ0 and ζ̄0 one finds simply In this section we construct the linearized covariant charges δQn ≡ δQ(ζn , h; g) associated to the diffeos ζn acting on the horizon. The construction of covariant charges has a long history including [45–51]. Formally, the linearized charges are expected to generate the linearized action, via Dirac brackets, of ζn on the on-shell linearized fluctuation h around  where X is a spacetime one-form constructed from the geometry and linear in h.5 X is not a priori fully determined by the considerations of [49, 50], where its precise form is left as an ambiguity. Ultimately one hopes it is fixed by consistency conditions such as integrability and the demand that the charges generate the symmetry via a Dirac bracket as in [7], or in the quantum form by action on a Hilbert space. In practice the determination of X has been made on a case-by-case basis. Our case involves a surface Σ with interior boundary on the far past of the future horizon, namely the bifurcation surface Σ bif at w± = 0. The boundary charge on ∂Σ = Σbif is the black hole contribution to the charge. We will find below consistency conditions that require a nonzero X. A candidate that enables them to be satisfied is simply a fixed background g. The formal argument proceeds from the fact that they reduce to the covariant symplectic form with one argument the ζ-transformed perturbation h. However, in practice many subtleties arise when attempting to verify such expectations. Among other things one must reduce, via gauge fixing and the application of the constraints, with careful analyses of zero modes and boundary conditions, to a physical phase space on which the symplectic form is nondegenerate. Various obstructions may arise, such as non-integrability of the charges or violations of associativity which necessitate the addition of boundary counterterms as discussed for example in [37, 48–51]. In the much simpler case of horizon supertranslations of Schwarzschild, it was verified in full detail [7] that the linearized charges δQf do indeed generate the linearized symmetries as expected. Moreover, the δQf were in this case recently explicitly integrated to the full horizon supertranslation charges Qf [37]. The δQn of interest here are significantly more complicated than their supertranslation counterparts δQf . We leave a comprehensive analysis of δQn in the style of [7] to future work, and the present analysis should therefore be regarded as a preliminary first step. The construction of covariant charges has been reviewed in many places (e.g. [52]) and is recapped in the appendix. The general form for the linearized charge associated to a diffeo ζ on a surface Σ with boundary ∂Σ is [50] a measure of the rotational velocity of the horizon. Here the null vectors `a and na are both normal to Σbif and normalized such that ` · n = −1. ` (n) is taken to be normal to the future (past) horizon.6 qab = gab + `a nb + na `b is the induced metric on Σbif .7 As a check on the normalization, we note that Moreover, under these conditions, it has been proven (as reviewed in [52]) that the central term must be constant on the phase space and given, for some constant cR by  up to terms which can be set to zero by shifting the charges. In order to evaluate the charge and the central terms we must specify falloffs for hab near ∂Σ = Σbif . One might demand that all components of hab (which is always required to be on shell) approach finite functions at Σbif at some rate as in [37]. However this condition is violated by the hab produced by the large diffeos ζn . We accordingly augment the phase space to allow for these pure gauge modes as well as the on-shell non-gauge modes that approach finite values at Σbif .8 These oscillate periodically in the affine time along the null generators and do not approach a definite value at Σbif , which is at infinite affine distance from any finite point on the horizon. Were they not pure gauge, such oscillating and n must be invariant under 2π rotations which act in conformal coordinates as (3.5). This is These conditions uniquely fixes ` and n up to a smooth rescaling under which Xa → ∂a φ. We could fix this ambiguity by demanding e.g. that Ω be divergence-free on Σbif but this condition will not be relevant at the order to which we work. 7 See for example [82] for a nice review of hypersurface geometry in the context of black holes. 8 The details of these rates are important for a complete investigation of integrability. We also restrict here to the phase space of fixed J. This is an analog of fixing the number of branes in string theory, which indeed in some cases is U -dual to the higher-dimensional angular momentum.  Here δM g is the linearized variation of the Kerr metric at fixed J. The Wald-Zoupas term δQX does not contribute to this computation. We are especially interested in the central term in the Virasoro charge algebra. When the charge is integrable and there is a well-defined (invertible and associative) Dirac bracket {, } on the reduced phase space, or in quantum language when Qm is realized as an operator generating the diffeo ζn on a Hilbert space, one has  Temperature dependence of the central term (5.15) violates the theorem [52] that it must be constant on the phase space. Hence there is an obstruction to constructing and integrating the charges δQIW with well-defined associative Dirac brackets, the existence of which is assumed in the theorem. We seek to remove this obstruction on the phase space of constant J by a suitable choice of X. However, we wish to stress the absence of this obstruction is necessary, but not a priori sufficient, for δQ to exist as an operator on a Hilbert space with all the desired properties including integrability. This is left to future investigations. Moreover, we have not shown that (5.5) is unique in eliminating this obstruction. The obstruction is eliminated by including the Wald-Zoupas contribution KXm,n =   perturbations would have infinite energy flux and would be physically excluded. In the (non-affine) null coordinate w+ along the horizon these modes can have poles at w+ = 0. We will find that the charges are nevertheless well-defined and have a smooth w+ → 0 limit with such pure gauge excitations. Moreover, the emergence of a nonvanishing central term relies on the poles: since ζ is actually tangent to Σbif precisely at w+ = 0, the δQX vanishes unless the perturbation produces a w+ -pole in X.9 We will define and compute these counterterms by working at small w+ and then taking the limit. This amounts to approaching Σbif along the future horizon. To evaluate the central term we take ζ = ζm and hab = Lζn g ab . It turns out that nonzero contributions to Kn,m from δQIW come only from the component FIW  On the past horizon, the range of w now goes to zero as Σbif is approached but again one finds the appearance of poles for, coming from terms such as ∂− ζ̄ y +y and h̄+y . FIW can be evaluated to be, ( Since Σbif is being approached from the past horizon, the vector fields `a and na are now defined so that ` is normal to the past horizon and n is normal to the future horizon. Again, both are null and satisfy ` · n = −1. An analysis of the periodicities gives  We note that the Wald-Zoupas counterterm δQX contributes only to cL − cR and not cL + cR and hence may be related to the holographic gravitational anomalies discussed in [76]. The area law  Using cL = cR = 12J as given above, the temperature formulae (2.4) and the Cardy formula SCardy = yields the Hawking-Bekenstein area-entropy law for generic Kerr For full quantum gravity, or even for linearized gravitons, it is not understood how to make such a decomposition. Nevertheless, in the stringy cases if Σdiv is taken to be the outer boundary of an AdS region, a practical working knowledge of how to proceed is well-established. Let us nevertheless imagine that we have achieved such a decomposition which makes sense at leading semiclassical order for any of the above choices of Σdiv . A state in the full Hilbert space may then be expressed as a sum over product states12 istence of such a decomposition is presumed in many discussions of black hole information. Consider a set of diffeos ζn , defined everywhere in the spacetime, which all vanish near spatial infinity, but in a neighborhood of Σdiv becomes a pair of Virasoros which act nontrivially on the black hole. Since the diffeos vanish at infinity, the associated full charges must annihilate the full quantum state See [83] for a recent review. We consider here black holes such as those formed in a collapse process with no second asymptotic region, so that complete spacelike slices with only one asymptotic boundary exist. 12 Very likely we will actually need an integral over Hilbert spaces corresponding to different boundary conditions on Σdiv [84–87] but we suppress this important point for notational brevity. In this concluding section we give a formal argument that, whenever black hole microstates are in representations of large-diffeomorphism-generated Virasoro algebras, as conjectured for Kerr in this paper, the black hole Hilbert space must be contained within the Hilbert space of states outside the black hole. The observations apply equally to the case discussed here and to the stringy black holes with near-AdS3 regions. Our argument is a refined and sharpened version of those made elsewhere from different perspectives and is perhaps in the general spirit, if not the letter, of black hole complementarity. 10 Consider a hypersurface Σdiv which divides the black hole spacetime into a black hole region and an asymptotically flat region with a hole. Σdiv may be taken to be the stretched horizon, the event horizon or in stringy cases the outer boundary of an AdS region: for the purposes of microstate counting the difference will be subleading and the distinction irrelevant. For a scalar field theory on such a fixed geometry it is reasonably well understood how to decompose the full Hilbert space Hfull of scalar excitations on a complete spacelike slice which goes through the black hole11 as a product of ‘black hole’ and ‘exterior’ Hilbert spaces HBH and Hext , following the Minkowski decomposition into the left and right Rindler Hilbert spaces. Roughly speaking, one expects the tensor product factorization,  On the other hand, beginning with the asymptotic surface integral expression for Qfull and integrating by parts we have Q(ζn )full = Q(ζn )ext + Q(ζn )BH . Equation (8.3) then becomes  That is, factorization of the Hilbert space with the inclusion of gravity fails in the most extreme possible way: there are no independent interior black hole microstates at all! This is of course a pleasing conclusion since the independent interior microstates are at the root of the information paradox. For supersymmetric black holes, Bogomolny bounds enforce degeneracies in the weights hk and the argument leading to (8.6) no longer works. Nevertheless, one may hope for a related mechanism, perhaps along the lines discussed in [88, 89] using discrete rather than continuous gauge symmetries, preventing an unwanted independent black hole Hilbert space.

In the generic case, absent any extra symmetries such as supersymmetry, we expect HBH to be composed of Virasoro representations with highest weight hk , where each hk is distinct. A black hole microstate is then uniquely determined by specifying the representation in which it lies and location therein. In that case, (8.5) can be satisfied only if Hext contains all the conjugate representations, and the constant cAb are chose so that |Ψfull i is a Virasoro singlet. At first the conclusion that the exterior state should transform under the Virasoro action may seem strange. But at second thought, the exterior region has an inner boundary on which ζn necessarily acts non-trivially, so this is entirely plausible. Given this state of affairs, it follows immediately that the specific black hole microstate in HBH is fully determined by complete measurement of the microstate in Hext : it is the unique element in the conjugate representation which forms a singlet with the exterior state. Instead of (8.1) we therefore have  with * being the Hodge dual.

Abstract: A set of infinitesimal Virasoro L ⊗ Virasoro R diffeomorphisms are presented which act non-trivially on the horizon of a generic Kerr black hole with spin J. The covariant phase space formalism provides a formula for the Virasoro charges as surface integrals on the horizon. Integrability and associativity of the charge algebra are shown to require the inclusion of ‘Wald-Zoupas’ counterterms. A counterterm satisfying the known consistency requirement is constructed and yields central charges cL = cR = 12J. Assuming the existence of a quantum Hilbert space on which these charges generate the symmetries, as well as the applicability of the Cardy formula, the central charges reproduce the macroscopic area-entropy law for generic Kerr black holes. Keywords: Black Holes, Gauge-gravity correspondence, Space-Time Symmetries	Sasha Haco,a,b Stephen W.

24	Paper17	2019	A Machian wave effect in conformal, scalar–tensor gravitational theory		Abstract A frequency-dependent Machian effect previously put forward by Woodward (that for a body undergoing mass–energy fluctuations, the second time derivative of the mass–energy density is a source of a gravitational field) is discussed within Einstein’s theory and justified using Hoyle–Narlikar’s conformal gravitational theory. It is shown that Einstein’s theory has a similar term that is 3rd order post-Newtonian, but besides the issue of coordinate-dependence, the Machian significance of any field term in Einstein’s equation depends on the (universe’s) cosmological solution to the field equations. Therefore, Woodward’s theory is examined within Hoyle–Narlikar’s scalar–tensor theory of gravitation (a theory that was expressly developed with the intent to incorporate Mach’s principle) for a universe undergoing accelerating expansion (hereby accounted for by a positive cosmological constant). It is shown under gauge invariant expressions that the conformal, scalar–tensor gravitational theory of Hoyle and Narlikar has a similar term of first order when the mass–energy fluctuation is due to distant objects but that it effectively becomes a higher order effect when the mass–energy fluctuations arise from fluctuation of the (local) mass–energy (as is necessarily the case in Woodward’s experimental results, since the only mass that can be purposively fluctuated in energy, monochromatically, is the local mass, instead of the distant masses responsible for most of the inertia according to Mach’s principle). Therefore this effect appears too small for practical space travel application (unless the spaceship is near a black hole or a neutron star). Present cosmological measurements of the possible time variation of G are shown to occur at much lower frequencies and therefore cannot be used to rule out Woodward’s effect if G exhibits significant timedependence at higher frequencies than observed in these cosmological measurements.

Previous EHT observations have used visibility amplitudes to infer the morphology of the millimeter-wavelength emission. Potentially much richer source information is contained in the phases. We report on 1.3 mm phase information on Sgr A* obtained with the EHT on a total of 13 observing nights over 4 years. Closure phases, the sum of visibility phases along a closed triangle of interferometer baselines, are used because they are robust against phase corruptions introduced by instrumentation and the rapidly variable atmosphere. The median closure phase on a triangle including telescopes in California, Hawaii, and Arizona is nonzero. This result conclusively demonstrates that the millimeter emission is asymmetric on scales of a few Schwarzschild radii and can be used to break 180◦ rotational ambiguities inherent from amplitude data alone. The stability of the sign of the closure phase over most observing nights indicates persistent asymmetry in the image of Sgr A* that is not obscured by refraction due to interstellar electrons along the line of sight. Subject headings: Galaxy: center — submillimeter: general — techniques: high angular resolution — techniques: interferometric 1. INTRODUCTION 1.1. The Event Horizon Telescope Sagittarius A* (Sgr A*), located at the Galactic center, marks a dark mass of just over 4 × 106 M⊙ (Ghez et al. 2008; Gillessen et al. 2009a,b; Chatzopoulos et al. 2015). At present there is no credible alternative to a supermassive black hole (Reid 2009). Its proximity makes it the best studied astronomical black hole candidate, one for which there is strong evidence that an event horizon exists (Broderick et al. 2009b). A variety of observations and theoretical models imply that the millimeter emission region lies within several Schwarzschild radii of the black hole (rSch = 2GMc−2 ≈ 10 µas). Directly resolving the region provides a powerful probe of the structure and dynamics near the horizon. General relativity predicts that Sgr A* will have a photon ring and associated shadow approximately 50 µas in diameter (Bardeen 1973; Falcke et al. 2000; Takahashi 2004). Spatially resolved observations thus hold great promise to assess the nature of the emission region (e.g., whether the millimeter-wavelength emission arises from a thick accretion disk or weak jet) as well as to test general relativity in the strong gravity regime (e.g., via the shape and size of the shadow; Bambi & Freese 2009; Johannsen & Psaltis 2010; Johannsen 2013; Broderick et al. 2014; Psaltis et al. 2015b; Ricarte & Dexter 2015). For this purpose the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) is being assembled. Comprised of new and existing telescopes at 1.3 mm and 0.87 mm, the EHT is a global array for very long baseline interferometry (VLBI) observations of nearby supermassive black holes, including Sgr A* (Doeleman et al. 2009). Uniquely among the many telescopes that observe Sgr A*, the EHT resolves structures on the scale of a few Schwarzschild radii in the inner accretion and outflow region. This resolution is well matched to the scales of the predicted physical and astrophysical features. Previously published EHT observations have used either the correlated flux density (Doeleman et al. 2008; Fish et al. 2011) or polarization (Johnson et al. 2015) on long baselines to infer the structure of Sgr A*. In this work, we focus on a third EHT data product, closure phases. 1.2. Closure Phases In a radio interferometric array, each baseline produces a complex observable known as the visibility, which is effectively a Fourier component of the source image. The visibility can be decomposed into two quantities: an amplitude and a phase. Both parts of the visibility contain information about the structure of the observed source. The amplitude alone can be sufficient to characterize the approximate size of a source (Doeleman et al. 2008, and others) and even permit modelling of the source structure (e.g., Broderick et al. 2009a; Moscibrodzka et al. 2009; Dexter et al. 2010), but most of ´ the detailed structural information is contained in the phase (Oppenheim & Lim 1981). For instance, Broderick et al. (2011b) demonstrated that the inclusion of phase data from just a few telescopes would nail down the spin vector of the black hole in an accretion flow model of Sgr A*. At the high frequencies at which the EHT observes, visibility phases are easily corrupted by rapidly varying tropospheric delays, primarily due to water vapor. A more robust phase observable is the closure phase, or sum of visibility phases along a closed loop of three baselines (Jennison 1958). Closure phases are immune to atmospheric phase fluctuations and to most other phase errors that are station-based rather than baseline-based in origin, such as phase variations in the receiver and local oscillator system at each station (Rogers et al. 1974). Closure phases that are neither zero nor 180◦ indicate that the source structure is not point-symmetric at the resolution of the observing array (Monnier 2007). Nonzero closure phases have been detected on bright quasar sources with the EHT and used to model the structure of these sources (Lu et al. 2012, 2013; Akiyama et al. 2015; Wagner et al. 2015), but the relative weakness of Sgr A* has heretofore only allowed a weak upper limit to be placed on the absolute value of its closure phase on the California-HawaiiArizona triangle (Fish et al. 2011). In this paper we report on detections of nonzero closure phases in Sgr A*, providing the first direct indication of asymmetric emission near the black hole. Multiple measurements of the closure phase of Sgr A* were obtained. We summarize the observing setup and methods of analysis in Sections 2 and 3, describe the results of the dataset in Section 4, examine implications for the quiescent and variable structure of Sgr A* in Section 5, and comment on future prospects for improved data in Section 6. 2. OBSERVATIONS The EHT obtained detections of Sgr A* on closed triangles of baselines among stations in Arizona, California, and Hawaii in 2009, 2011, 2012, and 2013. In all cases, two 480-MHz bands, centered at 229.089 and 229.601 GHz (hereafter called low and high bands, respectively), were observed. A hydrogen maser was used as the timing and frequency standard at all sites (but see Section 2.1.2). The two bands were correlated and post-processed independently. Digital backends and phased-array processors channelized each 480 MHz band into 15 channels of 32 MHz each. Data were recorded on the disk-based Mark 5B+ and Mark 5C systems (Whitney 2004; Whitney et al. 2010) and then correlated on the Haystack Mark 4 VLBI correlator (Whitney et al. 2004) with a spectral resolution of 1 MHz and an accumulation period of either 0.5 s or 1 s. Left-circular polarization (LCP) was always observed, and right-circular polarization (RCP) was observed in later experiments as well. We report only on closure quantities that do not mix polarizations. 2.1. Observing Array One or more telescopes from each of three sites in Arizona, California, and Hawaii participated in each set of observations. The Arizona Radio Observatory (ARO) Submillimeter Telescope (SMT) on Mt. Graham, Arizona was used in all cases. At the California and Hawaii sites, the capabilities of the instruments evolved through the years, transitioning to recording coherently phased sums of connected dishes. Over the years of data analyzed here, the configuration of VLBI recording at these sites evolved as described below. The Combined Array for Research in Millimeter-wave Astronomy (CARMA) in eastern California participated. Observations always consisted of two VLBI stations, one of which was a single 10.4-m antenna. A second 10.4-m antenna participated in 2009 and part of 2011. From 2011 day 091 onward, the second antenna was replaced by a more sensitive phased array of up to eight telescopes (including both the 10.4-m and 6.1-m antennas). Three observatories on Mauna Kea, Hawaii participated in observations: the Submillimeter Array (SMA), the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope (JCMT), and the Caltech Submillimeter Observatory (CSO). The SMA consisted of a phased array of up to eight telescopes (Weintroub 2008; Primiani et al. 2011). Table 1 summarizes the telescopes participating in each set of observations along with one-letter station codes, used hereafter. Typical fringe spacings are 60 µas on Hawaii-Arizona baselines, 70 µas on Hawaii-California baselines, and 300 µas on California-Arizona baselines. Two stations of the same polarization were used at theCARMA site in all experiments and on Mauna Kea in 2011. On arcsecond scales, extended thermal structures near Sgr A* contribute to the millimeter-wavelength interferometer response (e.g., Kunneriath et al. 2012). Examination of the correlated flux density as a function of baseline length indicates that this emission is resolved out on baselines longer than ∼ 20 kλ, or a projected baseline length of 26 m at λ = 1.3 mm. The intrasite VLBI baselines (CD, DF, EG, JP, and OP) were longer than 20 kλ except in 2009. Data quality at 1.3 mm is highly dependent on weather conditions, which are different from day to day and often variable on any given day as well. The sensitivity of the EHT was generally better in later years due to the inclusion of phased arrays on Mauna Kea and at the CARMA site. 2.1.1. 2009 Sgr A* was observed on days 093, 095, 096, and 097, although there were no detections on the CARMA-Hawaii baselines on day 095. The observing array consisted of the SMT, the JCMT, and two individual CARMA antennas each operating as co-located VLBI sites but using the same hydrogen maser as a time and frequency standard. Calibrated amplitudes from days 095, 096, and 097 have been published in Fish et al. (2011). There was significant power aliased into the observing band at the CARMA stations because the 90◦ phase-switching normally used to separate the sidebands from the doublesideband mixers was disabled during VLBI scans. This was not an issue for VLBI baselines between sites, for which natural fringe rotation was rapid enough to wash out the contribution from the opposite sideband. However, the other sideband was clearly visible in the fringe-rate spectrum on the intrasite CD baseline, introducing a nonclosing phase error on only the CD baseline. Additionally, stations C and D were not separated by a projected length of 20 kλ. As a result of these two effects, measured closure phases on the CDJ and CDS triangles are nonzero (see Section 3.2) and are therefore excluded from our analysis. 2.1.2. 2011 Sgr A* was observed on days 088, 090, 091, 092, and 094, although day 092 suffered from uncharacteristically high atmospheric turbulence at the CARMA site. The observing array consisted of the SMT, two stations at CARMA, and two stations at Hawaii. One station consisted of a single antenna (D). A second single antenna (C) was used in the low band on all days and the high band on days 088 and 090. Station C FIG. 1.— Consistency checks. Top: Multiple processings of the same trivial (left) and nontrivial (right) closure phases are consistent to much less than the thermal noise. Bottom: Pairwise differences of similar data points (as defined in Section 3.2) are consistent with being drawn from a Gaussian random distribution characterized by their errorbars, confirming that the error estimates are not biased. was replaced with the phased-array processor (F) in the high band starting with day 091. At Hawaii, the JCMT was used as a standalone antenna on day 088, and the CSO was used on the other days. The second station at Hawaii was a phased array that summed signals from SMA antennas plus either the CSO (day 088) or the JCMT (other days). While hydrogen masers were used at all sites, the digital backend sampler clocks, which are the final mix in the signal chain, were erroneously driven off of the local rubidium clock at CARMA on days 088-092. An analysis of calibrator sources indicated that this setup did not affect phase closure. Further details can be found in Lu et al. (2013). 2.1.3. 2012 Sgr A* was observed on day 075, 080, and 081, although only day 081 provided usable data on all three baselines. Each site provided dual-circular polarization observations, with the two polarizations coming from different telescopes at Mauna Kea. Disk failures caused the loss of LCP data from station S in the high band. 2.1.4. 2013 Sgr A* was observed on days 080, 081, 082, 085, and 086. The zenith opacity at the CARMA site was unusually low, dipping to 0.026 at one point, resulting in high sensitivity on the CARMA baselines on some nights. The failure of a Mark 5B+ recording system caused the loss of one polarization in one band at phased CARMA on most nights. Calibrated visibility amplitudes have been published in Johnson et al. (2015). 2.2. Sign Conventions In this work we adopt the sign conventions of Rogers et al. (1974) and Whitney et al. (2004). The delay on baseline AB is positive if the signal arrives at station B after station A. A positive delay produces a positive visibility phase modulo 2π ambiguities. The closure phase on a triangle of three baselines is defined to be the directed sum of the visibility phases in order: φABC ≡ φAB + φBC + φCA = φAB + φBC − φAC. 3.1. Fringe Search Methods Obtaining a closure phase requires detecting the source on a closed triangle of three baselines. In practice, source detection is accomplished by finding a peak in the scan amplitude in a multidimensional space defined by delays and the delayrate (residual to the correlator model values). The Haystack Observatory Postprocessing System (HOPS) provides tools to search delay/rate space and determine the signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) and probability of false detection associated with the peak. The rapidly variable troposphere at 1.3 mm introduces large phase fluctuations on each baseline, introducing challenges for fringe finding. When fringes are strong, coherent vector integration along the entire length of the scan is sufficient to detect the fringe despite the substantial coherence losses due to the rapidly varying phase. Once the delays are well determined, the atmospheric phase variations are mitigated by segmenting the data at a cadence shorter than the timescale over which the tropospheric phase changes appreciably. Since the tropospheric contribution to the measured visibility phases close, the visibility phases can be closed on a per-segment basis and then averaged over the length of the scan to produce a measurement of the closure phase of the source. The bispectral S/N of the resulting averaged closure phase can vary depending on the choice of segmentation time (Rogers et al. 1995). However, evaluated closure phases at different segmentation times are self-consistent provided that the segmentation time does not greatly exceed the coherence timescale. When fringes are weak, as is often the case on baselines between Hawaii and the mainland, HOPS supports additional strategies to aid in fringe detection. Delay closure can be used to set tight search windows, aiding in the detection of marginal fringes. Phase self-calibration on two strong baselines to a sensitive station can be used to mitigate atmospheric fluctuations on the third baseline of a triangle. Weak fringes can sometimes be detected using incoherent averaging, in which data are segmented at a cadence comparable to the coherence time of the atmosphere, and then those segments are scalar-averaged (Rogers et al. 1995). 3.2. Consistency Checks Since the optimal strategy for fringe detection and closure phase evaluation varies depending on the sensitivity of each station and atmospheric conditions, multiple strategies were employed, tailored to the particular characteristics of each dataset. When multiple measurements of the same closure phase were obtained through different processings, only the data point with the highest bispectral S/N was retained. The discarded duplicate points are consistent with the retained data points (top panels of Fig. 1), indicating that the particular methods chosen for fringe detection and closure phase evaluation do not significantly bias the data. There are two classes of triangles on which we obtain closure phases. Triangles that include two VLBI stations from the same site (e.g., DFS) should produce closure phases that are trivially zero to within measurement error. On the intrasite baseline of these “trivial” triangles, the large-scale emission in the Galactic Center (on scales & 10′′) is resolved out. Sgr A* is then pointlike, causing the intrinsic source phase to be zero. The two long baselines effectively sample the same (u,v) point, adding a source phase on one baseline and subtracting it on the other. There is no evidence of nonzero closure phases on Sgr A* or other sources in our data on the trivial triangles. “Nontrivial” closure phases on triangles involve one CARMA station, one station in Hawaii, and the SMT; these may be nonzero due to source structure. As another consistency check, we examined measurements of closure phases that should be identical to within their errors. It is possible that variations in Sgr A* may cause fluctuations in the closure phase from scan to scan. However, during any particular scan, it is possible to obtain more than one estimate of trivial and nontrivial closure phases due to duplications among the stations. The closure phases obtained in the low and high bands should be identical, since the fractional frequency difference between the observing bands is very small. Closure phases on, e.g., the FPS (LCP) and GJT (RCP) triangles should be identical, since Sgr A* exhibits almost no circular polarization at these frequencies (Muñoz et al. 2012; Johnson et al. 2015). Similarly, simultaneous closure phases on pairs of triangles that share the same sites but with different stations (e.g., DPS and FPS) should provide measurements of the same value. As expected, the pairwise differences of substantially identical closure phases are consistent with a unit Gaussian distribution centered on zero when the differences are normalized by the quadrature sum of the errors of the closure phases (bottom panels of Fig. 1). This also provides evidence that the closure phase errorbars are correctly estimated. 4. RESULTS In total we detect 181 unique nontrivial closure phases for Sgr A* on the California-Hawaii-Arizona triangle. We additionally detect 233 trivial closure phases. Detected scanaveraged closure phases are listed in Table 2. The data are shown in Figure 2. There are more data points in later epochs due to the increased sensitivity provided by phased SMA and, later, phased CARMA. Medians of the nontrivial closure phases are presented in Table 3 along with boot-strap estimates of the 95% confidence interval of the median, derived from random resampling with replacement. The median closure phase (+6.3◦ ) on the CaliforniaHawaii-Arizona triangle is positive at high statistical significance. In a larger run of 108 bootstrap-resampled datasets, every median was positive. This result is also robust against the exclusion of data from the day with the largest closure phase (2013 day 080); the resulting dataset has a median closure phase of 5.0◦ with a 95% lower bound of 3.1◦ . For comparison, the median trivial closure phase is 0.4◦ , consistent with zero (95% range: −0.2 ◦ to +1.2 ◦ ) as expected. The median nontrivial closure phase of +6.3◦ is too large to be attributable to instrumental effects (Appendix) and is nearly identical to the +6.7◦ measured in an independent analysis of 2013 data by R.-S. Lu et al. (in preparation) using both the Mark 4 and DiFX correlators. Care must be taken not to overinterpret differences between subsamples of the dataset. When individual days of data are processed in multiple ways, the median closure phase can differ by a few degrees. This is particularly true for data taken in 2009 and 2011 (before the sensitivity of the observing array was increased) or for subsamples consisting of only a few measurements, where the inclusion or exclusion of one or two marginal detections can have a greater impact on the derived median value. For instance, the median closure phase on 2011 day 094 increases from −0.3 ◦ to +3.5 ◦ when only self-calibrated data points are considered. The dataset taken as a whole is large enough to be robust against the details of the processing to within a few tenths of a degree. Since each baseline samples different (u,v) points at different times due to Earth rotation, it would be possible for the closure phase to vary as a function of time even if Sgr A* did not exhibit variability. Indeed, there is a trend for the measured California-Hawaii-Arizona closure phase to be larger later in the observing track (Fig. 3). The χ 2 per degree of freedom for the best-fit line is 1.43, indicating that there is additional variability and/or that the increase with time is not linear. This increase with GST is significant at a level of > 4σ using a Kendall tau test. The expected functional form as a function of GST is model-dependent, although the general trend for the California-Hawaii-Arizona closure phase to increase with time over an observing night provides an important constraint for physically motivated models of the 1.3 mm emission region in Sgr A*. 5. DISCUSSION Our data clearly demonstrate that the closure phase on the California-Hawaii-Arizona triangle is nonzero, with a trend for the magnitude of the closure phase to increase over the course of a night. The sign and approximate value of the closure phase are consistent among multiple observing epochs over four years. In this section we consider the implications of these results. 5.1. Implications of Nonzero Closure Phase The detection of nonzero closure phase is an unambiguous indication that these EHT data are resolving structure in the image of Sgr A*. Two robust conclusions are that the morphology of the emission from Sgr A* at 1.3 mm cannot exhibit point symmetry and that the millimeter emission is asymmetric on scales of a few Schwarzschild radii. The sign of the closure phase resolves 180◦ rotational ambiguities in models. As an example, the best-fit parameters for the Broderick et al. (2011a) model find that the rotation axis of the accretion disk points toward either −52◦ or +128◦ (2σ error +33◦/ − 24◦ ) east of north. This pair of directions was obtained from visibility amplitude information alone, which cannot discriminate between the two directions because the Fourier transforms of an image and the same image rotated 180◦ are identical modulo a sign flip in phase. Therefore, visibility phase or closure phase information is required to break the 180◦ degeneracy. The +128◦ direction is consistent in sign with our measured closure phases. Adding the new closure phase data is likely to result in better estimates of model parameters and to provide stronger constraints on models, including those that allow for deviations from general relativity (e.g., Broderick et al. 2014). 5.1.1. Accretion Models The detection of nonzero but small closure phases in the image of Sgr A* demonstrates the power of imaging observations in placing strong constraints on its accretion flow geometry. In particular, the data favor emission morphologies that are connected rather than those composed of disjoint regions at horizon scales. At this point, it is instructive to look at the images generated in different general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD) simulations in order to explore in more detail how our observations can be used to constrain various configurations that are physically plausible and are consistent with all other currently available data. The parameters of GRMHD simulations are typically calibrated in order to reproduce the broadband spectrum of Sgr A* as well as the overall size of its emitting region at 1.3 mm. Even with these constraints imposed, however, the images they generate can be quite different from each other, depending on the prescription for the plasma thermodynamics that was employed as well as on the initial magnetic field configuration and tilt of the torus that was used to feed the black hole. In a set of simulations referred to by Narayan et al. (2012) as Standard and Normal Evolution (SANE), the magnetic flux remains modest (e.g., De Villiers et al. 2003; Gammie et al. 2003). If the electron temperature is assumed to be at a constant ratio with the ion temperature everywhere in the flow, the generated images typically show continuous crescentlike brightness distributions (Moscibrodzka et al. 2009, 2012; ´ Dexter et al. 2009, 2010; Chan et al. 2015). On the other hand, if the electrons in the jet are allowed to be heated much more strongly than within the disk, the images are characterized by bright regions from the inner walls of the jets, dissected by the cooler accretion disks (Moscibrodzka & Falcke ´ 2013; Moscibrodzka et al. 2014; Chan et al. 2015). The rela- ´ tive brightness of the two regions (and their exact shape) de-pends on the inclination of the observer. Images with even more disjoint bright regions arise in Magnetically Arrested Disk simulations (MAD in the terminology of Narayan et al. 2012; see also McKinney & Blandford 2009 and Dexter et al. 2012 for similar magnetically dominated simulations and their applications to EHT observations of M87) and are dominated by emission from the footpoints of the jets (Chan et al. 2015). Finally, images with separated bright regions arise naturally in GRMHD simulations in which the accreting material is fed to the black hole from a plane that has a tilt with respect to the black-hole spin (Dexter & Fragile 2013) because of the presence of standing shocks in these flows. Comparing the detailed predictions of these simulations to our data is beyond the scope of the current paper. However, motivated by the rather general properties of the disjoint geometries in the images exhibited by some of the GRMHD simulations, we discuss below how the observations reported here can be used to constrain such configurations. 5.1.2. Constraints on Disjoint Bright Regions The gross characteristics of the jet-dominated images with disjoint bright regions described above (see Moscibrodzka & Falcke 2013; Mo ´ scibrodzka et al. 2014; ´ Chan et al. 2015) can be captured by a simple geometric model composed of two separated regions that are symmetric and identical except for a difference in the brightness of each component. The closure phases of such a configuration will be equivalent to an even more reduced model in which the two regions are replaced with point sources. In this reduced model, the visibilities are analytically calculable as V(u,v) = 1 + re−2πi(ux+vy) , where r represents the amplitude ratio of the two components, and x and y refer to their separation east and north, respectively1 . Figure 4 shows the separations between two point sources that are consistent with our data. These separations would produce California-Hawaii-Arizona closure phases that are between +0.9 ◦ and +14.9 ◦ , the range of values implied by the best-fit line in Figure 3, at all GST times for which we have measured closure phases. Both r = 0 (one point source) and r = 1 (two equal point sources) are inconsistent with our data, since each would produce closure phases that are identically zero or 180◦ . For a separation comparable to the shadow diameter, the closure phase data imply that a disconnected two-component model would be oriented roughly east-west with the brighter component located to the west (Figure 4). If the emission from Sgr A* is coming from the footpoints of a MAD-type jet, this is inconsistent with the orientations of the Li et al. (2013) jet or Bartko et al. (2009) clockwise disk (see extended discussion in Psaltis et al. 2015a) but aligned with the preferred axis of the intrinsic emission at 7 mm (Bower et al. 2014). Closure phase measurements at 86 GHz already rule out asymmetric jet structures on larger angular scales from a few hundred microarcseconds to a few milliarcseconds (Park et al. 2015). 5.2. Consistency of Closure Phases 5.2.1. Alignment of the Accretion Disk and Black Hole Spin Axes The closure phase on the California-Hawaii-Arizona triangle is consistent in sign and magnitude, to within measurement error, from day to day. These observations span a 4- year timescale that is much longer than the orbital period at the innermost stable circular orbit, which ranges from a few minutes to about half an hour depending on the spin of the black hole. It is also larger than the Lense-Thirring precession timescale for a tilted accretion disk unless the effective outer accretion flow radius is very large or the black hole spin is very small (Fragile et al. 2007; Dexter & Fragile 2013). Misalignment of the spin axes of the accretion disk and black hole could produce two different observational consequences. First, it is possible that the inner disk could have a stable but slowly precessing structure. Examination of each epoch of the data in the context of disk (e.g., Broderick et al. 2009a, 2011a) or geometric crescent models (Kamruddin & Dexter 2013) may be able to place limits on the amount of precession. Second, misalignment could result in multiple bright regions in the accretion flow due to standing shocks. GRMHD simulations of the accretion flow find that the separation between these regions is comparable to the diameter of the photon ring, although the emission pattern can be quite complicated in general (Dexter & Fragile 2013). Since the standing shocks can travel faster than the Lense-Thirring precession speed, the accretion flow would be expected to have substantially different structure in different years and very likely on different days within each year. The predicted closure phases over the course of a day on the California-Hawaii-Arizona triangle for the 515h model of Dexter & Fragile (2013) mimic the rough range of closure phases observed, including a general trend of increasing value with GST. Further study is required to determine whether such a model predicts excess variability in closure phases and long-baseline amplitudes beyond what is observed. The increased sensitivity of the EHT in upcoming years will be helpful for examining variability on intraday timescales. 5.2.2. Connections with the Accretion Rate The discovery of the G2 gas cloud on an orbit with a close approach to Sgr A* (Gillessen et al. 2012) sparked interest in the possibility that the accretion rate of Sgr A* would increase due to the introduction of additional material into the accretion flow. Most of the material in G2 did not pass through pericenter until after the final epoch of observations reported herein (Gillessen et al. 2013), and mounting evidence suggests that G2 contains a star and is therefore not a pure gas cloud (Eckart et al. 2014; Witzel et al. 2014; Valencia-S. et al. 2015). In any case, the infall timescale is on the order of years (Burkert et al. 2012), so it would not be expected for there to be observational signatures of the G2 event in these data. However, there is evidence that G2 is a knot in a larger gas streamer that also includes the G1 gas cloud, which reached pericenter in the middle of 2001 (Pfuhl et al. 2015). If so, the accretion flow of Sgr A* could be supplemented with material from G1 or other gas in the streamer, with the caveat that some of the material deposited in the outer accretion flow may be carried away by outflows rather than making it to the inner region traced by the 1.3 mm emission (Wang et al. 2013). The consistency of closure phases across multiple epochs from 2009 through 2013 provides evidence against large changes in the accretion rate over this period, consistent with the results of radio and millimeter-wavelength monitoring during the G2 encounter (Bower et al. 2015). The GRMHD simulations of Moscibrodzka et al. (2012) are in- ´ structive. When the accretion rate is decreased, the effective size of the accretion region decreases, with the result that the Hawaii-Arizona and Hawaii-California baselines do not adequately resolve the 1.3 mm emission region, causing the predicted closure phases to drop very close to zero. As the accretion rate is increased, the effective size of the emission region becomes larger, producing larger closure phases as the fringe spacing of the Hawaii-Arizona and HawaiiCalifornia baselines becomes better matched to the asymmetric emission region. These larger closure phases persist even at the largest accretion rates modelled by Moscibrodzka et al. ´ (2012), where the shadow of the emission region is obscured by the high optical depth of the accretion flow. This behavior is also seen when the accretion rate of the Broderick et al. (2011a) radiatively inefficient accretion flow models is varied. The average California-Hawaii-Arizona closure phase may therefore provide information complementary to visibility amplitudes in determining the overall accretion rate of the Sgr A* system. 5.2.3. Limits on Refractive Phase Noise Scattering in the tenuous plasma of the interstellar medium affects the image of Sgr A* at radio wavelengths. The biggest effect of this scattering is to blur the image of Sgr A*, causing its apparent size to vary approximately as the square of the observing wavelength (Davies et al. 1976; Lo et al. 1981; Doeleman et al. 2001; Bower et al. 2006, and many others). A secondary effect of scattering is to introduce variable substructure within the scattered image (Gwinn et al. 2014; Johnson & Gwinn 2015). Both of these effects can modify VLBI observables. The formalism of Narayan & Goodman (1989) and Goodman & Narayan (1989) distinguishes between three different regimes of scattering. In the snapshot regime, diffractive scattering from small-scale inhomogeneities dominates. In the average regime, diffractive scattering is quenched, but refractive scintillation from large-scale inhomogeneities persists. In the ensemble-average regime, both diffractive and refractive scintillation are suppressed, and the scattering produces a deterministic blurring of the image. Due to the intrinsic size of Sgr A* as well as the integration time and bandwidth used in VLBI observations, the average regime is applicable to EHT observations of Sgr A* over the course of a single night. The ensemble of many nights of observations will tend statistically toward the ensemble-average regime, in which the observed visibilities are the intrinsic visibilities downweighted by a real Gaussian whose width in baseline space is inversely related to the size of the scattering ellipse. In the ensemble-average regime, the effects of scattering— blurring of the image—are invertible and do not affect closure phases (Fish et al. 2014). However, in the average regime, image distortions and refractive substructure can introduce nonclosing phases. The magnitude of these effects may be up to 50 mJy in the visibility domain, with peak effect at baselines near the length atwhich the ensemble-average visibility of a point source falls to 1/ √ e (Johnson & Gwinn 2015). This could be as large as a 10% effect on top of source visibilities of approximately 500 mJy on the baselines between Hawaii and the mainland US (Fish et al. 2011), corresponding to a phase noise of ∼ 6 ◦ . However, this refractive phase noise will be partially correlated when the antennas are located within a few thousand kilometers of each other, so the net effect on closure phases on the California-Hawaii-Arizona triangle will be smaller. Because refractive phase noise will fluctuate randomly about zero on timescales of about 1 day (Fish et al. 2014), it cannot account for the nonzero closure phases that we measure, which show a strong tendency to be positive. Nor can refractive phase noise account for the dependence of closure phase on GST. Thus, our measurements are a secure indication of intrinsic source asymmetry and do not merely reflect scattering-induced asymmetrical substructure. However, refractive variations may contribute to smaller interday variations in closure phase. Further observations at a range of wavelengths will be required to characterize the properties of the turbulent scattering screen and better understand its contribution to the apparent variability of Sgr A*. 6. CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE PROSPECTS We have obtained 181 measurements of the closure phase at 1.3 mm on the California-Hawaii-Arizona triangle from 2009 to 2013. The median closure phase is nonzero at high statistical significance. This provides the first direct evidence that the structure of the 1.3 mm emission region is asymmetric on spatial scales comparable to the diameter of the shadow around the black hole that is predicted by general relativity. If the 1.3 mm emission arises from a MAD-like jet whose emission is concentrated in two disjoint bright regions separated by the shadow diameter, our data place a very strong constraint on its orientation. The data also provide important constraints for parameters of other outflow and accretion models of Sgr A*. The constancy of the sign of the closure phase argues for the persistence of asymmetric quiescent structure in Sgr A* likely coupled with some structural variability, consistent with simulations of a dynamic, spin-aligned accretion disk. While it is not currently possible to entirely disentangle the effects of variability in the structure of the emitting material around Sgr A* from apparent substructure introduced by variationsin the scattering screen, the California-Hawaii-Arizona closure phases indicate that refractive phase noise is not dominant on baselines between Hawaii and the western US. These results are encouraging for producing an image of the quiescent emission by averaging several nights of data to mitigate intrinsic source variability and refractive substructure (Lu et al. 2015). Closure phase measurements will soon provide much stronger constraints on source structure. In the near term, EHT observations in 2015 and beyond will incorporate additional observatories, including the Large Millimeter Telescope in Mexico, providing closure phase data on new triangles with higher angular resolution. Increasing data rates, starting with dual-polarization 2 GHz observations in 2015, will provide increased sensitivity that will result in larger detection rates and smaller random errors on each closure phase measurement, allowing interday and intraday variability to be tracked more accurately. Completion of the 1.3 mm VLBI array—including phased ALMA (Fish et al. 2013), the South Pole Telescope, the IRAM 30-m telescope at Pico Veleta, and the Northern Extended Millimeter Array at Plateau de Bure— will produce very sensitive data with good baseline coverage, culminating in the ability to reconstruct model-independent images of Sgr A*, M87, and other sources (Lu et al. 2014).

Facilities: EHT	ABSTRACT The Galactic Center black hole Sagittarius A* (Sgr A*) is a prime observing target for the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT), which can resolve the 1.3 mm emission from this source on angular scales comparable to that of the general relativistic shadow. Previous EHT observations have used visibility amplitudes to infer the morphology of the millimeter-wavelength emission. Potentially much richer source information is contained in the phases. We report on 1.3 mm phase information on Sgr A* obtained with the EHT on a total of 13 observing nights over 4 years. Closure phases, the sum of visibility phases along a closed triangle of interferometer baselines, are used because they are robust against phase corruptions introduced by instrumentation and the rapidly variable atmosphere. The median closure phase on a triangle including telescopes in California, Hawaii, and Arizona is nonzero. This result conclusively demonstrates that the millimeter emission is asymmetric on scales of a few Schwarzschild radii and can be used to break 180◦ rotational ambiguities inherent from amplitude data alone. The stability of the sign of the closure phase over most observing nights indicates persistent asymmetry in the image of Sgr A* that is not obscured by refraction due to interstellar electrons along the line of sight. Subject headings: Galaxy: center — submillimeter: general — techniques: high angular resolution — techniques: interferometric	VINCENT L.

26	Paper19	2019	Tests of General Relativity with the Binary Black Hole Signals from the LIGO-Virgo Catalog GWTC-1	Tests of General Relativity with the Binary Black Hole Signals from the LIGO-Virgo Catalog GWTC-1 The LIGO Scientific Collaboration and the Virgo Collaboration The detection of gravitational waves by Advanced LIGO and Advanced Virgo provides an opportunity to test general relativity in a regime that is inaccessible to traditional astronomical observations and laboratory tests. We present four tests of the consistency of the data with binary black hole gravitational waveforms predicted by general relativity. One test subtracts the best-fit waveform from the data and checks the consistency of the residual with detector noise. The second test checks the consistency of the low- and high-frequency parts of the observed signals. The third test checks that phenomenological deviations introduced in the waveform model (including in the post-Newtonian coefficients) are consistent with zero. The fourth test constrains modifications to the propagation of gravitational waves due to a modified dispersion relation, including that from a massive graviton. We present results both for individual events and also results obtained by combining together particularly strong events from the first and second observing runs of Advanced LIGO and Advanced Virgo, as collected in the catalog GWTC-1. We do not find any inconsistency of the data with the predictions of general relativity and improve our previously presented combined constraints by factors of 1.1 to 2.4. In particular, we bound the mass of the graviton to be mg ≤ 5.0 × 10−23 eV/c 2 (90% credible level), an improvement of a factor of 1.5 over our previously presented results. Additionally, we check that the four gravitational-wave events published for the first time in GWTC-1 do not lead to stronger constraints on alternative polarizations than those published previously. I. INTRODUCTION Einstein’s theory of gravity, general relativity (GR), has withstood a large number of experimental tests [1]. With the advent of gravitational-wave (GW) astronomy and the observations by the Advanced LIGO [2] and Advanced Virgo [3] detectors, a range of new tests of GR have become possible. These include both weak field tests of the propagation of GWs, as well as tests of the strong field regime of compact binary sources. See [4–8] for previous applications of such tests to GW data. We report results from tests of GR on all the confident binary black hole GW events in the catalog GWTC-1 [9], i.e., those from the first and second observing runs of the advanced generation of detectors. Besides all of the events previously announced (GW150914, GW151012, GW151226, GW170104, GW170608, and GW170814) [5–7, 10–13], this includes the four new GW events reported in [14] (GW170729, GW170809, GW170818, and GW170823). We do not investigate any of the marginal triggers in GWTC-1, which have a false-alarm rate (FAR) greater than one per year. Table I displays a complete list of the events we consider. Tests of GR on the binary neutron star event GW170817 are described in [8]. The search results in [14] originate from two modeled searches and one weakly modeled search [5, 11, 14, 15]. The modeled searches use templates based on GR to find candidate events and to assess their significance. However, detection by such searches does not in itself imply full compatibility of the signal with GR [16, 17]. The weakly modeled search relies on coherence of signals between multiple detectors, as expected for an astrophysical source. While it assumes that the morphology of the signal resembles a chirp (whose frequency increases with time), as expected for a compact binary coalescence, it does not assume that the detailed waveform shape agrees with GR. A transient signal strongly deviating from GR would likely be found by the weakly modeled search, even if missed by the modeled searches. So far, however, all significant [FAR < (1 yr) −1 ] transient signals found by the weakly modeled search were also found by at least one of the modeled searches [14]. At present, there are no complete theories of gravity other than GR that are mathematically and physically viable and provide well defined alternative predictions for the waveforms arising from the coalescence of two black holes (if, indeed, these theories even admit black holes). Thus, we cannot test GR by direct comparison with other specific theories. Instead, we can (i) check the consistency of the GR predictions with the data and (ii) introduce ad hoc modifications in GR waveforms to determine the degree to which the values of the deviation parameters agree with GR. These methods are agnostic to any particular choice of alternative theory. For the most part, our results should therefore be interpreted as observational constraints on possible GW phenomenologies, independent of the overall suitability or well-posedness of any specific alternative to GR. These limits are useful in providing a quantitative indication of the degree to which the data is described by GR; they may also be interpreted more specifically in the context of any given alternative to produce constraints, if applicable. In particular, with regard to the consistency of the GR predictions (i), we (a) look for residual power after subtracting the best-fitting GR waveform from the data, and (b) evaluate the consistency of the high and low frequency components of the observed signal. With regard to deviations from GR (ii), we separately introduce parametrizations for (a) the emitted waveform, and (b) its propagation. The former could be viewed as representing possible GR modifications in the strong-field region close to the binary, while the latter would correspond to weak-field modifications away from the source. Although we consider these independently, modifications to GW propagation would most likely be accompanied by modifications to GW generation in any given extension of GR. We have also checked that none of the events discussed here provide stronger constraints on models with purely vector and purely scalar GW polarizations than those previously published in [7, 8]. Our analyses do not reveal any inconsistency of the data with the arXiv:1903.04467v2 [gr-qc] 28 Mar 2019 2 predictions of GR. Limits on deviations from GR for individual events are dominated by statistical errors due to detector noise. These errors can be reduced by appropriately combining results from multiple events. Sources of systematic errors, on the other hand, include uncertainties in the detector calibration and power spectral density (PSD) estimation and errors in the modeling of waveforms in GR. Detector calibration uncertainties are modeled as corrections to the measured detector response function and are marginalized over. Studies on the effect of PSD uncertainties are currently ongoing. A full characterization of the systematic errors due to the GR waveform models that we employ is beyond the scope of this study; some investigations can be found in [18–22]. This paper is organized as follows. Section II provides an overview of the data sets employed here, while Sec. III details which GW events are used to produce the individual and combined results presented in this paper. In Sec. IV we explain the gravitational waveforms and data analysis formalisms which our tests of GR are based on, before we present the results in the following sections. Section V contains two signal consistency tests: the residuals test in V A and the inspiral-mergerringdown consistency test in V B. Results from parameterized tests are given in Sec. VI for GW generation, and in Sec. VII for GW propagation. We briefly discuss the study of GW polarizations in Sec. VIII. Finally, we conclude in Sec. IX. We give results for individual events and some checks on waveform systematics in the Appendix. The results of each test and associated data products can be found in Ref. [23]. The GW strain data for all the events considered are available at the Gravitational Wave Open Science Center [24]. II. DATA, CALIBRATION AND CLEANING The first observing run of Advanced LIGO (O1) lasted from September 12th, 2015 to January 19th, 2016. The second observing run (O2) lasted from November 30th, 2016 to August 25th, 2017, with the Advanced Virgo observatory joining on August 1st, 2017. This paper includes all GW events originating from the coalescence of two black holes found in these two data sets and published in [5, 14]. The GW detector’s response to changes in the differential arm length (the interferometer’s degree of freedom most sensitive to GWs) must be calibrated using independent, accurate, absolute references. The LIGO detectors use photon recoil (radiation pressure) from auxiliary laser systems to induce mirror motions that change the arm cavity lengths, allowing a direct measure of the detector response [25–27]. Calibration of Virgo relies on measurements of Michelson interference fringes as the main optics swing freely, using the primary laser wavelength as a fiducial length. Subsequent measurements propagate the calibration to arrive at the final detector response [28, 29]. These complex-valued, frequency-dependent measurements of the LIGO and Virgo detectors’ response yield the uncertainty in their respective estimated amplitude and phase of the GW strain output. The amplitude and phase correction factors are modeled as cubic splines and marginalized over in the estimation of astrophysical source parameters [14, 30–32]. Additionally, the uncertainty in the time stamping of Virgo data (much larger than the LIGO timing uncertainty, which is included in the phase correction factor) is also accounted for in the analysis. Post-processing techniques to subtract noise contributions and frequency lines from the data around gravitational-wave events were developed in O2 and introduced in [7, 13, 33], for the astrophysical parameter estimation of GW170608, GW170814, and GW170817. This noise subtraction was achieved using optimal Wiener filters to calculate coupling transfer functions from auxiliary sensors [34]. A new, optimized parallelizable method in the frequency domain [35] allows large scale noise subtraction on LIGO data. All of the O2 analyses presented in this manuscript use the noise-subtracted data set with the latest calibration available. The O1 data set is the same used in previous publications, as the effect of noise subtraction is expected to be negligible. Reanalysis of the O1 events is motivated by improvements in the parameter estimation pipeline, an improved frequency-dependent calibration, and the availability of new waveform models. III. EVENTS AND SIGNIFICANCE We present results for all confident detections of binary black hole events in GTWC-1 [9], i.e., all such events detected during O1 and O2 with a FAR lower than one per year, as published in [14]. The central columns of Table I list the FARs of each event as evaluated by the three search pipelines used in [14]. Two of these pipelines (PyCBC and GstLAL) rely on waveform templates computed from binary black hole coalescences in GR. Making use of a measure of significance that assumes the validity of GR could potentially lead to biases in the selection of events to be tested, systematically disfavoring signals in which a GR violation would be most evident. Therefore, it is important to consider the possibilities that (1) there were GW signals with such large deviations from GR that they were missed entirely by the modeled searches, and (2) there were events that were picked up by the modeled searches but classified as marginal (and thus excluded from our analysis) because of their significant deviations from GR. These worries can largely be dispelled by considering the third GW search pipeline, the coherent WaveBurst (cWB) weakly modeled search presented in [14]. This cWB search [15, 36, 37] was tuned to detect chirping signals—like those that would be expected from compact binary coalescences—but was not tuned to any specific GR predictions.1 cWB is most sensitive to short signals from high-mass binary black holes. It is still able to detect signals from lower-mass binaries (e.g., GW151226), though with reduced significance compared to the modeled searches. Thus, a signal from a low-mass binary, 1 Chirping signals from compact binary coalescences are a feature of many theories of gravity. All that is required is that the orbital frequency increases as the binary radiates energy and angular momentum in GWs. 3 or a marginal event, with a significant departure from the GR predictions (hence not detected by the GR modeled searches) would not necessarily be detected by the cWB search with a FAR < (1 yr) −1 . However, if there is a population of such signals, they will not all be weak and/or from low-mass binaries. Thus, one would expect some of the signals in the population to be detected by cWB, even if they evade detection by the modeled searches. All signals detected by the cWB search with FAR < (1 yr) −1 were also found by at least one modeled search with FAR < (1 yr) −1 . Given the above considerations, this is evidence that our analysis does not exclude chirping GW signals that were missed in the modeled searches because of drastic departures from GR. Similarly, this is also evidence against the possibility of marginal events representing a population of GRdeviating signals, as none of them show high significance [FAR < (1 yr) −1 ] in the cWB search only. Thus, we believe that we have not biased our analysis by considering only the ten events with FAR < (1 yr)−1 , as published in [14]. We consider each of the GW events individually, carrying out different analyses on a case-by-case basis. Some of the tests presented here, such as the inspiral-merger-ringdown (IMR) consistency test in Sec. V B and the parameterized tests in Sec. VI, distinguish between the inspiral and the postinspiral regimes of the signal. The separation between these two regimes is performed in the frequency-domain, choosing a particular cutoff frequency determined by the parameters of the event. Larger-mass systems merge at lower frequencies, presenting a short inspiral signal in band; lower mass systems have longer observable inspiral signals, but the detector’s sensitivity decreases at higher frequencies and hence the post-inspiral signal becomes less informative. Therefore, depending on the total mass of the system, a particular signal might not provide enough information within the sensitive frequency band of the GW detectors for all analyses. As a proxy for the amount of information that can be extracted from each part of the signal, we calculate the signal-tonoise ratio (SNR) of the inspiral and the post-inspiral parts of the signals separately. We only apply inspiral (post-inspiral) tests if the inspiral (post-inspiral) SNR is greater than 6. Each test uses a different inspiral-cutoff frequency, and hence they assign different SNRs to the two regimes (details provided in the relevant section for each test). In Table I we indicate which analyses have been performed on which event, based on this frequency and the corresponding SNR.2 In addition to the individual analysis of each event, we derive combined constraints on departures from GR using multiple signals simultaneously. Constraints from individual events are largely dominated by statistical uncertainties due to detector noise. Combining events together can reduce such statistical errors on parameters that take consistent values across all events. 2 While we perform these tests on all events with SNR > 6 in the appropriate regime, in a few cases the results appear uninformative and the posterior distribution extends across the entire prior considered. Since the results are prior dependent, upper limits should not be set from these individual analyses. See Sec. 3 of the Appendix for details. However, it is impossible to make joint probabilistic statements from multiple events without prior assumptions about the nature of each observation and how it relates to others in the set. This means that, although there are well-defined statistical procedures for producing joint results, there is no unique way of doing so. In light of this, we adopt what we take to be the most straightforward strategy, although future studies may follow different criteria. First, in combining events we assume that deviations from GR are manifested equally across events, independent of source properties. This is justified for studies of modified GW propagation, since those effects should not depend on the source.3 For other analyses, it is quite a strong assumption to take all deviations from GR to be independent of source properties. Such combined tests should not be expected to necessarily reveal generic source-dependent deviations, although they might if the departures from GR are large enough (see, e.g., [38]). Future work may circumvent this issue by combining marginalized likelihood ratios (Bayes factors), instead of posterior probability distributions [39]. Second, we choose to produce combined constraints only from events that were found in both modeled searches (PyCBC [40–42] and GstLAL [43, 44]) with a FAR of at most one per one-thousand years. This ensures that there is a very small probability of inclusion of a non-astrophysical event. The events used for the combined results are indicated with bold names in Table I. The events thus excluded from the combined analysis have low SNR and would therefore contribute only marginally to tightened constraints. Excluding marginal events from our analyses amounts to assigning a null a priori probability to the possibility that those data contain any information about the tests in question. This is, in a sense, the most conservative choice. In summary, we enforce two significance thresholds: FAR < (1 yr) −1 , for single-event analyses, and FAR < (1000 yr) −1 , for combined results. This two-tiered setup allows us to produce conservative joint results by including only the most significant events, while also providing information about a broader (less significant) set of triggers. This is intended to enable the interested reader to combine individual results with less stringent criteria and under different statistical assumptions, according to their specific needs and tolerance for false positives. In the future, we may adapt our thresholds depending on the rate of detections. IV. PARAMETER INFERENCE The starting point for all the analyses presented here are waveform models that describe the GWs emitted by coalescing black-hole binaries. The GW signature depends on the intrinsic parameters describing the binary as well as the extrinsic parameters specifying the location and orientation of the source with respect to the detector network. The intrinsic parameters for circularized black-hole binaries in GR are the two masses mi of the black holes and the two spin vectors S~i defining the rotation of each black hole, where i ∈ {1, 2} labels the two black holes. We assume that the binary has negligible orbital eccentricity, as is expected to be the case when the binary enters the band of ground-based detectors [45, 46] (except in some more extreme formation scenarios,4 e.g., [54–57]). The extrinsic parameters comprise four parameters that specify the space-time location of the binary black-hole, namely the sky location (right ascension and declination), the luminosity distance, and the time of coalescence. In addition, there are three extrinsic parameters that determine the orientation of the binary with respect to Earth, namely the inclination angle of the orbit with respect to the observer, the polarization angle, and the orbital phase at coalescence. We employ two waveform families that model binary black holes in GR: the effective-one-body based SEOBNRv4 [18] waveform family that assumes non-precessing spins for the black holes (we use the frequency domain reduced order 4 These scenarios could occur often enough, compared to the expected rate of detections, that the inclusion of eccentricity in waveform models is a necessity for tests of GR in future observing runs; see, e.g., [47–53] for recent work on developing such waveform models. model SEOBNRv4 ROM for reasons of computational efficiency), and the phenomenological waveform family IMRPhenomPv2 [19, 58, 59] that models the effects of precessing spins using two effective parameters by twisting up the underlying aligned-spin model. We use IMRPhenomPv2 to obtain all the main results given in this paper, and use SEOBNRv4 to check the robustness of these results, whenever possible. When we use IMRPhenomPv2, we impose a prior m1/m2 ≤ 18 on the mass ratio, as the waveform family is not calibrated against numerical relativity simulations for m1/m2 > 18. We do not impose a similar prior when using SEOBNRv4, since it includes information about the extreme mass ratio limit. Neither of these waveform models includes the full spin dynamics (which requires 6 spin parameters). Fully precessing waveform models have been recently developed [21, 60–62] and will be used in future applications of these tests. The waveform models used in this paper do not include the effects of subdominant (non-quadrupole) modes, which are expected to be small for comparable-mass binaries [63, 64]. The first generation of binary black hole waveform models including spin and higher order modes has recently been developed [62, 65–67]. Preliminary results in [14], using NR simulations supplemented by NR surrogate waveforms, indicate that the higher mode content of the GW signals detected by Advanced LIGO and Virgo is weak enough that models without the effect of subdominant modes do not introduce sub- 5 stantial biases in the intrinsic parameters of the binary. For unequal-mass binaries, the effect of the non-quadrupole modes is more pronounced [68], particularly when the binary’s orientation is close to edge-on. In these cases, the presence of non-quadrupole modes can show up as a deviation from GR when using waveforms that only include the quadrupole modes, as was shown in [69]. Applications of tests of GR with the new waveform models that include non-quadrupole modes will be carried out in the future. We believe that our simplifying assumptions on the waveform models (zero eccentricity, simplified treatment of spins, and neglect of subdominant modes) are justified by astrophysical considerations and previous studies. Indeed, as we show in the remainder of the paper, the observed signals are consistent with the waveform models. Of course, had our analyses resulted in evidence for violations of GR, we would have had to revisit these simplifications very carefully. The tests described in this paper are performed within the framework of Bayesian inference, by means of the LALInference code [31] in the LIGO Scientific Collaboration Algorithm Library Suite (LALSuite) [70]. We estimate the PSD using the BayesWave code [71, 72], as described in Appendix B of [14]. Except for the residuals test described in Sec. V A, we use the waveform models described in this section to estimate from the data the posterior distributions of the parameters of the binary. These include not only the intrinsic and extrinsic parameters mentioned above, but also other parameters that describe possible departures from the GR predictions. Specifically, for the parameterized tests in Secs. VI and VII, we modify the phase Φ(f) of the frequency-domain waveform h˜(f) = A(f)e iΦ(f) . (1) For the GR parameters, we use the same prior distributions as the main parameter estimation analysis described in [14], though for a number of the tests we need to extend the ranges of these priors to account for correlations with the non-GR parameters, or for the fact that only a portion of the signal is analyzed (as in Sec. V B). We also use the same low-frequency cutoffs for the likelihood integral as in [14], i.e., 20 Hz for all events except for GW170608, where 30 Hz is used for LIGO Hanford, as discussed in [13], and GW170818, where 16 Hz is used for all three detectors. For the model agnostic residual test described in Sec. V A, we use the BayesWave code [71] which describes the GW signals in terms of a number of Morlet-Gabor wavelets. V. CONSISTENCY TESTS A. Residuals test One way to evaluate the ability of GR to describe GW signals is to subtract the best-fit template from the data and make sure the residuals have the statistical properties expected of instrumental noise. This largely model-independent test is sensitive to a wide range of possible disagreements between the data and our waveform models, including those caused by deviations from GR and by modeling systematics. This analysis can look for GR violations without relying on specific parametrizations of the deviations, making it a versatile tool. Results from a similar study on our first detection were already presented in [4]. In order to establish whether the residuals agree with noise (Gaussian or otherwise), we proceed as follows. For each event in our set, we use LALInference and the IMRPhenomPv2 waveform family to obtain an estimate of the best-fit (i.e., maximum likelihood) binary black-hole waveform based on GR.5 This waveform incorporates factors that account for uncertainty in the detector calibration, as described in Sec. II. This best-fit waveform is then subtracted from the data to obtain the residuals. If the GR-based model provides a good description of the signal, we expect the resulting residuals at each detector to lack any significant coherent SNR beyond what is expected from noise fluctuations. We compute the coherent SNR using BayesWave, which models the multi-detector residuals as a superposition of incoherent Gaussian noise and an ellipticallypolarized coherent signal. The residual network SNR reported by BayesWave is the SNR that would correspond to such a coherent signal. In particular, for each event, BayesWave produces a distribution of possible residual signals consistent with the data, together with corresponding a posteriori probabilities. This is trivially translated into a probability distribution over the coherent residual SNR. We summarize each of these distributions by computing the corresponding 90%-credible upper limit (SNR90). This produces one number per event that represents an upper bound on the coherent power that could be present in its residuals. We may translate the SNR90 into a measure of how well the best-fit templates describe the signals in our data. We do this through the fitting factor [73], FF B SNRGR /(SNR2 res + SNR2 GR) 1/2 , where SNRres is the coherent residual SNR and SNRGR is the network SNR of the best-fit template (see Table I for network SNRs). By setting SNRres = SNR90, we produce a 90%-credible lower limit on the fitting factor (FF90). Because FF is itself a lower limit on the overlap between the true and best-fit templates, so is FF90. As in [4], we may then assert that the disagreement between the true waveform and our GRbased template is at most (1−FF90)×100%. This is interesting as a measure of the sensitivity of our test, but does not tell us about the consistency of the residuals with instrumental noise. To assess whether the obtained residual SNR90 values are consistent with detector noise, we run an identical BayesWave analysis on 200 different sets of noise-only detector data near each event. This allows us to estimate the p-value for the null hypothesis that the residuals are consistent with noise. The pvalue gives the probability of noise producing coherent power Our results are summarized in Table II. For each event, we present the values of the residual SNR90, the lower limit on the fitting factor (FF90), and the SNR90 p-value. The background distributions that resulted in those p-values are shown in Fig. 1. In Fig. 1 we represent these distributions through the empirical estimate of their survival functions, i.e., p(SNR90) = 1 − CDF(SNR90), with “CDF” the cumulative distribution function. Fig. 1 also displays the actual value of SNR90 measured from the residuals of each event (dotted vertical line). In each case, the height of the curve evaluated at the SNR90 measured for the corresponding detection yields the p-value reported in Table II (markers in Fig. 1). The values of residual SNR90 vary widely among events because they depend on the specific state of the instruments at the time of detection: segments of data with elevated noise levels are more likely to result in spurious coherent residual power, even if the signal agrees with GR. In particular, the background distributions for events seen by three detectors are qualitatively different from those seen by only two. This is both due to (i) the fact that BayesWave is configured to expect the SNR to increase with the number of detectors and (ii) the fact that Virgo data present a higher rate of non-Gaussianities than LIGO. We have confirmed both these factors play a role by studying the background SNR90 distributions for real data from each possible pair of detectors, as well as distributions over fabricated Gaussian noise. Specifically, removing Virgo from the analysis results in a reduction in the coherent residual power for GW170729 (SNRHL 90 = 6.0), GW170809 (SNRHL 90 = 6.3), GW170814 (SNRHL 90 = 5.9), and GW170818 (SNRHL 90 = 6.6). The event-by-event variation of SNR90 is also reflected in the values of FF90. GW150914 provides the strongest result with FF90 = 0.97, which corresponds to an upper limit of 3% on the magnitude of potential deviations from our GR-based template,7 in the specific sense defined in [4] and discussed above. On the other hand, GW170818 yields the weakest result with FF90 = 0.78 and a corresponding upper limit on waveform mismatch of 22%. The average FF90 over all events is 0.89. The set of p-values shown in Table II is consistent with all coherent residual power being due to instrumental noise. Assuming that this is indeed the case, we expect the p-values to be uniformly distributed over [0, 1], which explains the variation in Table II. With only ten events, however, it is difficult to obtain strong quantitative evidence of the uniformity of this distribution. Nevertheless, we follow Fisher’s method [74] to compute a meta p-value for the null hypothesis that the individual p-values in Table II are uniformly distributed. We obtain a meta p-value of 0.4, implying that there is no evidence for coherent residual power that cannot be explained by noise alone. 6 Computing p-values would not be necessary if the noise was perfectThe inspiral-merger-ringdown consistency test for binary black holes [38, 75] checks the consistency of the lowfrequency part of the observed signal (roughly corresponding to the inspiral of the black holes) with the high-frequency part (to a good approximation, produced by the post-inspiral stages). The cutoff frequency fc between the two regimes is chosen as the frequency of the innermost stable circular orbit of a Kerr black hole [76], with mass and dimensionless spin equal to the median values of the posterior distribution of the remnant’s mass and spin. This determination of fc is performed separately for each event and based on parameter inference of the full signal (see Table III for values of fc).8 The binary’s parameters are then estimated independently from the low (high) frequency parts of the data by restricting the noiseweighted integral in the likelihood calculation to frequencies below (above) this frequency cutoff fc. For each of these independent estimates of the source parameters, we make use of fits to numerical-relativity simulations given in [77–79] to infer the mass Mf and dimensionless spin magnitude af = c|S~f |/(GM2 f ) of the remnant black hole.9 If the data are consistent with GR, these two independent estimates have to be consistent with each other [38, 75]. Because this consistency test ultimately compares between the inspiral and the post-inspiral results, posteriors of both parts must be informative. In the case of low-mass binaries, the SNR in the part f > fc is insufficient to perform this test, so that we only analyze seven events as indicated in Tables I and III. In order to quantify the consistency of the two different estimates of the final black hole’s mass and spin we define two dimensionless quantities that quantify the fractional difference between them: ∆Mf/M¯	The detection of gravitational waves by Advanced LIGO and Advanced Virgo provides an opportunity to test general relativity in a regime that is inaccessible to traditional astronomical observations and laboratory tests. We present four tests of the consistency of the data with binary black hole gravitational waveforms predicted by general relativity. One test subtracts the best-fit waveform from the data and checks the consistency of the residual with detector noise. The second test checks the consistency of the low- and high-frequency parts of the observed signals. The third test checks that phenomenological deviations introduced in the waveform model (including in the post-Newtonian coefficients) are consistent with zero. The fourth test constrains modifications to the propagation of gravitational waves due to a modified dispersion relation, including that from a massive graviton. We present results both for individual events and also results obtained by combining together particularly strong events from the first and second observing runs of Advanced LIGO and Advanced Virgo, as collected in the catalog GWTC-1. We do not find any inconsistency of the data with the predictions of general relativity and improve our previously presented combined constraints by factors of 1.1 to 2.4. In particular, we bound the mass of the graviton to be mg ≤ 5.0 × 10−23 eV/c 2 (90% credible level), an improvement of a factor of 1.5 over our previously presented results. Additionally, we check that the four gravitational-wave events published for the first time in GWTC-1 do not lead to stronger constraints on alternative polarizations than those published previously.

For all events, the posteriors are consistent with the GR value (∆Mf/M¯ f = 0, ∆af/a¯f = 0). The fraction of the posterior enclosed by the isoprobability contour that passes through the GR value (i.e., the GR quantile) for each event is shown in Table III. Figure 2 also shows the posteriors obtained by combining all the events that pass the stronger significance threshold FAR < (1000 yr) −1 , as outlined in Sec. III (see the same section for a discussion of caveats). The parameter estimation is performed employing uniform priors in component masses and spin magnitudes and isotropic priors in spin directions [14]. This will introduce a non-flat prior in the deviation parameters ∆Mf/M¯ f and ∆af/a¯f , which is shown as a thin, dashed contour in Fig. 2. Posteriors are estimated employing the precessing spin phenomenological waveform family IMRPhenomPv2. To assess the systematic errors due to imperfect waveform modeling, we also estimate the posteriors using the effective-one-body based waveform family SEOBNRv4 that models binary black holes with nonprecessing spins. There is no qualitative difference between the results derived using the two different waveforms families (see Sec. 2 of the Appendix). We see additional peaks in the posteriors estimated from GW170814 and GW170823. Detailed follow-up investigations did not show any evidence of the presence of a coherent signal in multiple detectors that differs from the GR prediction. The second peak in GW170814 is introduced by the posterior of M post-insp f , while the extra peak in GW170823 is introduced by the posterior of M insp f . Injection studies in real data around the time of these events, using simulated GR waveforms with parameters consistent with GW170814 and GW170823, suggest that such secondary peaks occur for ∼ 10% of injections. Features in the posteriors of GW170814 and GW170823 are thus consistent with expected noise fluctuations. VI. PARAMETERIZED TESTS OF GRAVITATIONAL WAVE GENERATION A deviation from GR could manifest itself as a modification of the dynamics of two orbiting compact objects, and in particular, the evolution of the orbital (and hence, GW) phase. In an analytical waveform model like IMRPhenomPv2, the details of the GW phase evolution are controlled by coefficients that are either analytically calculated or determined by fits to numerical-relativity (NR) simulations, always under the assumption that GR is the underlying theory. These coefficients have a functional dependence on the intrinsic parameters of the binary that is specific to GR (masses and spins for binary black holes). In this section we investigate deviations from the GR binary dynamics by introducing shifts in each of the individual GW phase coefficients of IMRPhenomPv2. We then treat those shifts as additional unconstrained GR-violating parameters, which we measure in addition to the standard parameters describing the binary. The early inspiral of compact binaries is well modeled by the post-Newtonian (PN) approximation [81–84] to GR, which is based on the expansion of the orbital quantities in terms of a small velocity parameter v/c. For a given set of intrinsic parameters, coefficients for the different orders in v/c in the PN series are uniquely determined. A consistency test of GR using measurements of the inspiral PN phase coefficients was first proposed in [85–87], while a generalized parametrization was motivated in [88]. Bayesian implementations based on such parametrized methods were presented and tested in [39, 89– 91] and were also extended to the post-inspiral part of the gravitational-wave signal [92, 93]. These ideas were applied to the first GW observation, GW150914 [10], yielding the first bounds on higher-order PN coefficients [4]. Since then, the constraints have been revised with the binary black hole events that followed, GW151226 in O1 [5] and GW170104 in O2 [6]. More recently, the first such constraints from a binary neutron star merger were placed with the detection of GW170817 [8]. Bounds on parametrized violations of GR from GW detections have been mapped, to leading order, to constraints on specific alternative theories of gravity (see, e.g., [94]). In this paper, we present individual constraints on parametrized deviations from GR for each of the GW sources in O1 and O2 listed in Table I, as well as the tightest combined constraints obtained to date by combining information from all the significant binary black holes events observed so far, as described in Sec. III. The frequency-domain GW phase evolution Φ(f) in the early-inspiral stage of IMRPhenomPv2 is described by a PN expansion, augmented with higher-order phenomenological coefficients. The PN phase evolution is analytically expressed in closed form by employing the stationary phase approximation. The late-inspiral and post-inspiral (intermediate and mergerringdown) stages are described by phenomenological analytical expressions. In all cases, the phenomenological coefficients are calibrated with data from NR simulations of mass-ratios as asymmetric as 1 : 18 and of dimensionless spin-magnitudes up to 0.99, as well as the inspiral portion of (uncalibrated) EOB waveforms. The transition frequency11 from inspiral to intermediate regime is given by the condition GM f /c 3 = 0.018, with M the total mass of the binary in the detector frame, since this is the lowest frequency above which this model was calibrated with NR data [19]. Deviations from GR in all three stages are expressed by means of relative shifts δpˆi in the corresponding waveform coefficients: pi → (1 + δpˆi) pi , which are used as additional free parameters in our extended waveform models. We denote the testing parameters corresponding to PN phase coefficients by δϕˆi , where i indicates the power of v/c beyond leading (Newtonian or 0PN) order in Φ(f). The frequency dependence of the corresponding phase term is f (i−5)/3 . In the parametrized model, i varies from 0 to 7, including the terms with logarithmic dependence at 2.5PN and 3PN. The nonlogarithmic term at 2.5PN (i.e., i = 5) cannot be constrained, because of its degeneracy with a constant reference phase (e.g., the phase at coalescence). These coefficients were introduced in their current form in Eq. (19) of [89]. In addition, we also test for i = −2, representing an effective −1PN term, which is motivated below. The full set of inspiral parameters are thus {δϕˆ−2, δϕˆ 0, δϕˆ 1, δϕˆ 2, δϕˆ 3, δϕˆ 4, δϕˆ 5l , δϕˆ 6, δϕˆ 6l , δϕˆ 7}. Since the −1PN term and the 0.5PN term are absent in the GR phasing, we parametrize δϕˆ−2 and δϕˆ 1 as absolute deviations, with a pre-factor equal to the 0PN coefficient. The −1PN term of δϕˆ 2 can be interpreted as arising from the emission of dipolar radiation. For binary black holes, this could occur in, e.g., alternative theories of gravity where an additional scalar charge is sourced by terms related to curvature [95, 96]. At leading order, this introduces a deviation in the −1PN coefficient of the waveform [97, 98]. This effectively introduces a term in the inspiral GW phase, varying with frequency as f −7/3 , while the gravitational flux is modified as FGR → FGR(1 + Bc2 /v2 ). The first bound on δϕˆ−2 was published in [8]. The higher-order terms in the above expansion also lead to a modification in the higher-order PN coefficients. Unlike the case of GW170817 (which we study separately in [8]), where the higher-order terms in the expansion of the flux are negligible, the contribution of higher-order terms can be significant in the binary black-hole signals that we study here. This prohibits an exact interpretation of the −1PN term as the strength of dipolar radiation. Hence, this analysis only serves as a test of the presence of an effective −1PN term in the inspiral phasing, which is absent in GR. To measure the above GR violations in the post-Newtonian inspiral, we employ two waveform models: (i) the analytical frequency-domain model IMRPhenomPv2 which also provided the natural parametrization for our tests and (ii) SEOBNRv4, which we use in the form of SEOBNRv4 ROM, a frequencydomain, reduced-order-model of the SEOBNRv4 model. The inspiral part of SEOBNRv4 is based on a numerical evolution of the aligned-spin effective-one-body dynamics of the binary, while its post-inspiral evolution is calibrated against NR simulations. Despite its non-analytical nature, SEOBNRv4 ROM can also be used to test the parametrized modifications of the early inspiral defined above. Using the method presented in [8], we add deviations to the waveform phase corresponding to a given δϕˆi at low frequencies and then taper the corrections to zero at a frequency consistent with the transition frequency between early-inspiral and intermediate phases used by IMRPhenomPv2. The same procedure cannot be applied to the later stages of the waveform, thus the analysis performed with SEOBNRv4 is restricted to the post-Newtonian inspiral, cf. Fig. 3. The analytical descriptions of the intermediate and mergerringdown stages in the IMRPhenomPv2 model allow for a straightforward way of parametrizing deviations from GR, denoted by {δβˆ 2, δβˆ 3} and {δαˆ 2, δαˆ 3, δαˆ 4} respectively, following [93]. Here the parameters δβˆ i correspond to deviations from the NR-calibrated phenomenological coefficients βi of the intermediate stage, while the parameters δαˆi refer to modifications of the merger-ringdown coefficients αi obtained from a combination of phenomenological fits and analytical blackhole perturbation theory calculations [19]. Using LALInference, we calculate posterior distributions of the parameters characterizing the waveform (including those that describe the binary in GR). Our parametrization recovers GR at δpˆi = 0, so consistency with GR is verified if the posteriors of δpˆi have support at zero. We perform the analyses by varying one δpˆi at a time; as shown in Ref. [99], this is fully robust to detecting deviations present in multiple PN-orders. In addition, allowing for a larger parameter space by varying multiple coefficients simultaneously would not improve our efficiency in identifying violations of GR, as it would yield less informative posteriors. A specific alternative theory of gravity would likely yield correlated deviations in many parameters, including modifications that we have not considered here. This would be the target of an exact comparison of an alternative theory with GR, which would only be possible if a complete, accurate description of the inspiral-merger-ringdown signal in that theory was available. We use priors uniform on δpˆi and symmetric around zero. Figure 3 shows the combined posteriors of δpˆi (marginalized over all other parameters) estimated from the combination of all the events that cross the significance threshold of FAR < (1000 yr)−1 in both modeled searches; see Table I. Events with SNR< 6 in the inspiral regime (parameters δϕˆi) or in the post-inspiral regime (δβˆ i and δαˆi for the intermediate and merger-ringdown parameters respectively) are not included in the results, since the data from those instances failed to provide useful constraints (see Sec. III for more details). This SNR threshold, however, is not equally effective in ensuring informative results for all cases; see Sec. 3 in the Appendix for a detailed discussion. In all cases considered, the posteriors are consistent with δpˆi = 0 within statistical fluctuations. Bounds on the inspiral coefficients obtained with the two different waveform models are found to be in good agreement with each other. Finally, we note that the event-combining analyses on δpˆi assume that these parametrized violations are constant across all events considered. This assumption should not be made when testing a specific theory that predicts violations that depend on the binary’s parameters. Posterior distributions of δpˆi for the individual-event analysis, also showing full consistency with GR, are provided in Sec. 3 of the Appendix. Figure 4 shows the 90% upper bounds on |δϕˆi | for all the individual events which cross the SNR threshold (SNR > 6) in the inspiral regime (the most massive of which is GW150914). The bounds from the combined posteriors are also shown; these include the events which exceed both the SNR threshold in the inspiral regime as well as the significance threshold, namely GW150914, GW151226, GW170104, GW170608, and GW170814. The bound from the likely lightest mass binary black hole event GW170608 at 1.5PN is currently the strongest constraint obtained on a positive PN coefficient from a single binary black hole event, as shown in Fig. 4. However, the constraint at this order is about five times worse than that obtained from the binary neutron star event GW170817 alone [8]. The −1PN bound is two orders of magnitude better for GW170817 than the best bound obtained from GW170608. For all other PN orders, GW170608 also provides the best bounds, which at high PN orders are of the same order of magnitude as the ones from GW170817. Our results can be compared statistically to those obtained by performing the same tests on simulated GR and non-GR waveforms given in [93]. The results presented here are consistent with those of GR waveforms injected into realistic detector data. The combined bounds are the tightest obtained so far, improving on the bounds obtained in [5] by factors between 1.1 and 1.8. VII. PARAMETERIZED TESTS OF GRAVITATIONAL WAVE PROPAGATION We now place constraints on a phenomenological modification of the GW dispersion relation, i.e., on a possible frequency dependence of the speed of GWs. This modification, introduced in [100] and first applied to LIGO data in [6], is obtained by adding a power-law term in the momentum to the dispersion relation E  Here, c is the speed of light, E and p are the energy and momentum of the GWs, and Aα and α are phenomenological parameters. We consider α values from 0 to 4 in steps of 0.5. However, we exclude α = 2, where the speed of the GWs is modified in a frequency-independent manner, and therefore gives no observable dephasing.12 Thus, in all cases except for α = 0, we are considering a Lorentz-violating dispersion relation. The group velocity associated with this dispersion  The associated length scale is λA B hc|Aα| 1/(α−2), where h is Planck’s constant. λA gives the scale of modifications to the Newtonian potential (the Yukawa potential for α = 0) associated with this dispersion relation. While Eq. (2) is a purely phenomenological model, it encompasses a variety of more fundamental predictions (at least to leading order) [94, 100]. In particular, A0 > 0 corresponds to a massive graviton, i.e., the same dispersion as for a massive particle in vacuo [102], with a graviton mass given by mg = A 1/2 0 /c 2 . 13 Furthermore, α values of 2.5, 3, and 4 correspond to the leading predictions of multi-fractal spacetime [103]; doubly special relativity [104]; and HoˇravaLifshitz [105] and extra dimensional [106] theories, respectively. The standard model extension also gives a leading contribution with α = 4 [107], only considering the non-birefringent terms; our analysis does not allow for birefringence. In order to obtain a waveform model with which to constrain these propagation effects, we start by assuming that the waveform extracted in the binary’s local wave zone (i.e., near to the binary compared to the distance from the binary to Earth, but far from the binary compared to its own size) is well-described by a waveform in GR.14 Since we are able to individual events. We give the analogous plots for the individual events in Sec. 4 of the Appendix. The combined positive and negative Aα posteriors are also used to compute the GR quantiles given in Table IV, which give the probability to have Aα < 0, where Aα = 0 is the GR value. Thus, large or small values of the GR quantile indicate that the distribution is not peaked close to the GR value. For a GR signal, the GR quantile will be distributed uniformly in [0, 1] for different noise realizations. The GR quantiles we find are consistent with such a uniform distribution. In particular, the (two-tailed) meta p-value for all events and α values obtained using Fisher’s method [74] (as in Sec. V A) is 0.9995. We find that the combined bounds overall improve on those quoted in [6] by roughly the factor of √ 7/3 ' 1.5 expected from including more events, with the bounds for some quantities improving by up to a factor of 2.4, due to the inclusion of several more massive and distant systems in the sample. These massive and distant systems, notably GW170823 (and GW170729, which is not included in the combined results), generally give the best individual bounds, particularly for small values of α, where the dephasing is largest at lower frequencies. Closer and less massive systems such as GW151226 and GW170608 provide weaker bounds, overall. However, their bounds can be comparable to those of the more massive, distant events for larger values of α. The lighter systems have more power at higher frequencies where the dephasing from the modified dispersion is larger for larger values of α. The new combined bound on the mass of the graviton of mg ≤ 5.0 × 10−23 eV/c 2 is a factor of 1.5 improvement on the one presented in [6]. It is also a small improvement on the bound of mg ≤ 6.76 × 10−23 eV/c 2 (90% confidence level) obtained from Solar System ephemerides in [112].17 However, these bounds are complementary, since the GW bound comes 17 The much stronger bound in [113] is deduced from a post-fit analysis (i.e., using the residuals of a fit to Solar System ephemerides performed without including the effects of a massive graviton). It may therefore overestimate Solar System constraints, as is indeed seen to be the case in [112]. from the radiative sector, while the Solar System bound considers the static modification to the Newtonian potential. See, e.g., [114] for a review of bounds on the mass of the graviton. We find that the posterior on Aα peaks away from 0 in some cases (illustrated in Sec. 4 of the Appendix), and the GR quantile is in one of the tails of the distribution. This feature is expected for a few out of 10 events, simply from Gaussian noise fluctuations. We have performed simulations of 100 GR sources with source-frame component masses lying between 25 and 45 M, isotropically distributed spins with dimensionless magnitudes up to 0.99, and at luminosity distances between 500 and 800 Mpc. These simulations used the waveform model IMRPhenomPv2 and considered the Advanced LIGO and Virgo network, using Gaussian noise with the detectors’ design sensitivity power spectral densities. We found that in about 20 – 30% of cases, the GR quantile lies in the tails of the distribution (i.e., < 10% or > 90%), when the sources injected are analyzed using the same waveform model (IMRPhenomPv2). In order to assess the impact of waveform systematics, we also analyze some events using the aligned-spin SEOBNRv4 model. We consider GW170729 and GW170814 in depth in this study because the GR quantiles of the IMRPhenomPv2 results lie in the tails of the distributions, and find that the 90% upper bounds and GR quantiles presented in Table IV differ by at most a factor of 2.3 for GW170729 and 1.5 for GW170814 when computed using the SEOBNRv4 model. These results are presented in Sec. 4 of the Appendix. There are also uncertainties in the determination of the 90% bounds due to the finite number of samples and the long tails of the distributions. As in Ref. [6], we quantify this uncertainty using Bayesian bootstrapping [115]. We use 1000 bootstrap realizations for each value of α and sign of Aα, obtaining a distribution of 90% bounds on Aα. We consider the 90% credible interval of this distribution and find that its width is < 30% of the values for the 90% bounds on Aα given in Table IV for all but 10 of the 160 cases we consider (counting positive and negative Aα cases separately). For GW170608, A4 < 0, the width of the 90% credible interval from bootstrapping is 91% of the value in Table IV. This ratio is ≤ 47% for all VIII. POLARIZATIONS Generic metric theories of gravity may allow up to six polarizations of gravitational waves [116]: two tensor modes (helicity ±2), two vector modes (helicity ±1), and two scalar modes (helicity 0). Of these, only the two tensor modes (+ and ×) are permitted in GR. We may attempt to reconstruct the polarization content of a passing GW using a network of detectors [1, 117–120]. This is possible because instruments with different orientations will respond differently to signals from a given sky location depending on their polarization. In particular, the strain signal in detector I can be written as  the detector’s response function and hA(t) the A-polarized part of the signal [1, 121]. In order to fully disentangle the polarization content of a transient signal, at least 5 detectors are needed to break all degeneracies [117].18 This limits the polarization measurements that are currently feasible. In spite of this, we may extract some polarization information from signals detected with both LIGO detectors and Virgo [120]. This was done previously with GW170814 and GW170817 to provide evidence that GWs are tensor polarized, instead of fully vector or fully scalar [7, 8]. Besides GW170814, there are three binary black hole events that were detected with the full network (GW170729, GW170809, and GW170818). Of these events, only GW170818 has enough SNR and is sufficiently well localized to provide any relevant information (cf. Fig. 8 in [14]). The Bayes factors (marginalized likelihood ratios) obtained in this case are 12±3 for tensor vs vector and 407±100 for tensor vs scalar, where the error corresponds to the uncertainty due to discrete sampling in the evidence computations. These values are comparable to those from GW170814, for which the latest recalibrated and cleaned data (cf. Sec. II) yield Bayes factors of 30 ± 4 and 220 ± 27 for tensor vs vector and scalar respectively.19 Values from these binary black holes are many orders of magnitude weaker than those obtained from GW170817, where we benefited from the precise sky-localization provided by an electromagnetic counterpart [8]. IX. CONCLUSIONS AND OUTLOOK We have presented the results from various tests of GR performed using the binary black hole signals from the catalog GWTC-1 [9], i.e., those observed by Advanced LIGO and 18 Differential-arm detectors are only sensitive to the traceless scalar mode, meaning we can only hope to distinguish five, not six, polarizations. 19 These values are less stringent than those previously published in [7]. This is solely due to the change in data, which impacted the sky locations inferred under the non-GR hypotheses. Advanced Virgo during the first two observing runs of the advanced detector era. These tests, which are among the first tests of GR in the highly relativistic, nonlinear regime of strong gravity, do not reveal any inconsistency of our data with the predictions of GR. We have presented full results on four tests of the consistency of the data with gravitational waveforms from binary black hole systems as predicted by GR. The first two of these tests check the self-consistency of our analysis. One checks that the residual remaining after subtracting the best-fit waveform is consistent with detector noise. The other checks that the final mass and spin inferred from the low- and high-frequency parts of the signal are consistent. The third and fourth tests introduce parameterized deviations in the waveform model and check that these deviations are consistent with their GR value of zero. In one test, these deviations are completely phenomenological modifications of the coefficients in a waveform model, including the post-Newtonian coefficients. In the other test, the deviations are those arising from the propagation of GWs with a modified dispersion relation, which includes the dispersion due to a massive graviton as a special case. In addition, we also check whether the observed polarizations are consistent with being purely tensor modes (as expected in GR) as opposed to purely scalar modes or vector modes. We present results from all binary black hole events that are detected with a false alarm rate better than (1 yr) −1 . This includes results from the re-analysis of some of the events which were published earlier [4–7], with better calibration and data quality. Assuming that the parameters that describe deviations from GR take values that are independent of source properties, we can combine results from multiple events. We choose to combine results only from highly significant events, detected with a false alarm rate better than (1000 yr) −1 in both modeled searches. Combining together these results has allowed us to significantly reduce the statistical errors on constraints on deviations from GR predictions, as compared to those from individual events. The combined constraints presented here improve our previously presented constraints by factors of 1.1 to 2.4, with the largest improvements obtained for certain cases of the modified dispersion test. Notable constraints include that on the graviton’s mass mg ≤ 5.0 × 10−23 eV/c 2 (an improvement of a factor of 1.5 over previously presented constraints) and the first constraint on the −1PN coefficient obtained from binary black holes. With the expected observations of additional binary black hole merger events in the upcoming LIGO/Virgo observing runs [14, 122], the statistical errors of the combined results will soon decrease significantly. A number of potential sources of systematic errors (due to imperfect modeling of GR waveforms, calibration uncertainties, noise artifacts, etc.) need to be understood for future high-precision tests of strong gravity using GW observations. However, work to improve the analysis on all these fronts is well underway, for instance the inclusion of full spin-precession dynamics [21, 60–62], non-quadrupolar modes [62, 65–67], and eccentricity [47–53] in waveform models, as well as analyses that compare directly with numerical relativity waveforms [123, 124]. Additionally, a new, more flexible parameter estimation infrastructure is currently being 14 developed [125], and this will allow for improvements in, e.g., the treatment of calibration uncertainties or PSD estimation to be incorporated more easily. We thus expect that tests of general relativity using the data from upcoming observing runs will be able to take full advantage of the increased sensitivity of the detectors. Appendix: Individual results and systematics studies In the main body of the paper, for most analyses, we present only the combined results from all events. Here we present the posteriors from various tests obtained from individual events. In addition, we offer a limited discussion on systematic errors in the analysis, due to the specific choice of a GR waveform approximant. 1. Residuals test As mentioned in Sec. V A, the residuals test is sensitive to all kinds of mismatch between the best-fit GR-based waveform and the data. This is true whether the mismatch is due to actual deviations from GR or more mundane reasons, like physics missing from our waveform models (e.g., higher-order modes). Had we found compelling evidence of coherent power in the residuals that could not be explained by instrumental noise, further investigations would be required to determine its origin. However, given our null result, we can simply state that we find no evidence for shortcomings in the best-fit waveform, neither from deviations from GR nor modeling systematics. As the sensitivity of the detectors improves, the issue of systematics will become increasingly more important. To address this, future versions of this test will be carried out by subtracting a best-fit waveform produced with more accurate GR-based models, including numerical relativity. 2. Inspiral-merger-ringdown consistency test In order to gauge the systematic errors in the IMR consistency test results due to imperfect waveform modeling, we have also estimated the posteriors of the deviation parameters ∆Mf/M¯ f and ∆af/a¯f using the effective-one-body based waveform family SEOBNRv4 that models binary black holes with non-precessing spins. This analysis uses the same priors as used in the main analysis presented in Sec.V B, except that spins are assumed to be aligned/antialigned with the orbital angular momentum of the binary. The resulting posteriors are presented in Fig. 7 and are broadly consistent with the posteriors using IMRPhenomPv2 presented in Fig. 2. The differences in the posteriors of some of the individual events are not surprising, due to the different assumptions on the spins. For all events, the GR value is recovered in the 90% credible region of the posteriors. 3. Parametrized tests of gravitational wave generation Figures 8 and 9 report the parameterized tests of waveform deviations for the individual events, augmenting the results shown in Fig. 3. A statistical summary of the posterior PDFs, showing median and symmetric 90% credible level bounds for the measured parameters is given in Table V. Sources with low SNR in the inspiral regime yield uninformative posterior distributions on δϕˆi . These sources are the ones further away and with higher mass, which merge at lower frequencies. For instance, although GW170823 has a total mass close to that of GW150914, being much further away (and redshifted to lower frequencies) makes it a low-SNR event, leaving very little information content in the inspiral regime. The same holds true for GW170729, which has a larger mass. Conversely, lowmass events like GW170608, having a significantly larger SNR in the inspiral regime and many more cycles in the frequency band provide very strong constraints in the δϕˆi parameters (especially the low-order ones) while providing no useful constraints in the merger-ringdown parameters δαˆi . The choice of the SNR > 6 threshold explained in Sec. III ensures that most analyses are informative. However, this is not true in all cases, as not all parameters are as easily determined from the data (cf. the good constraints one obtains on the chirp mass with the much weaker constraints on the mass ratio). The two events for which the SNR threshold is insufficient are GW151012 and GW170608, where some post-inspiral parameters are largely unconstrained. The post-inspiral regime is itself divided into the intermediate and merger-ringdown regimes, and for both these events we find the intermediate regime parameters (δβˆ i) to be informative; however, the merger– ringdown δαˆ 3 for GW170608 and all δαˆi for GW151012 extend across the entire prior range considered in the analyses, far beyond the range constrained by other events (as can be seen in Fig. 9). Although we use the results from GW170608 δαˆi for combining posteriors in Fig. 3, the combined bounds remain unaffected by adding these results. For future tests, a more discerning threshold than a simple SNR cut, for example including information like the number of cycles of the signal in band, may be used to select which events will provide useful constraints. Both here and in Sec. VI we report results on the parametrized deviations in the PN regime using two waveform models, IMRPhenomPv2 and SEOBNRv4. There is a subtle difference between the ways deviations from GR are introduced and parametrized in the two models. With IMRPhenomPv2, we directly constrain δϕˆi , which represent fractional deviations in the non-spinning portion of the (i/2)PN phase coefficients. The SEOBNRv4 analysis instead uses a parameterization that also applies the fractional deviations to spin contributions, as described in [8]. The results are then mapped post-hoc from this native parameterization to posteriors on δϕˆi , shown in Figs. 3 and 8 (black solid lines). In the SEOBNRv4 analysis at 3.5PN, the native (spininclusive) posteriors contain tails that extend to the edge of the prior range. This is due to a zero-crossing of the 3.5PN term in the (η, a1, a2) parameter space, which makes the corresponding relative deviation ill-defined. After the post-hoc mapping to posteriors on δϕˆ 7, no tails appear and we find good agreement with the IMRPhenomPv2 analysis, as expected. By varying the prior range, we estimate a systematic uncertainty of at most a few percent on the quoted 90% bounds due to the truncation of tails. 4. Parameterized tests of gravitational wave propagation Posteriors on Aα for individual events are shown in Fig. 10, with data for positive and negative Aα combined into one violin plot. We provide results for all events with the IMRPhenomPv2 waveform model and also show results of the analysis with the SEOBNRv4 waveform model for GW170729 and GW170814. In Table VI we compare the 90% bounds on Aα and GR quantiles obtained with IMRPhenomPv2 and SEOBNRv4 for GW170729 and GW170814. We focus on these two events because the GR quantiles obtained with IMRPhenomPv2 lie in the tails of the distributions, and we find that this remains true for most α values in the analysis with SEOBNRv4. For GW170729 and α ∈ {0, 0.5, 1}, the GR quantiles obtained using the two waveforms differ by factors of ∼ 2; the two waveforms give values that are in much closer agreement for the other cases. Additionally, for the GW151012 event and certain α values, a technical issue with our computation of the likelihood meant that specific points with relatively large values of Aα had to be manually removed from the posterior distribution. In particular, for computational efficiency, the likelihood is calculated on as short a segment of data as practical, with duration set by the longest waveform to be sampled. Large values of Aα yield highly dispersed waveforms that are pushed beyond the confines of the segment we use, causing the waveform templates to wrap around the boundaries. This invalidates the assumptions 		
28	Paper20	2018	Black hole entropy and quantum mechanics	Black hole entropy and quantum mechanics Juan Maldacena Institute for Advanced Study, Princeton, NJ 08540, U.S.A. Abstract We give a brief overview of black hole entropy, covering a few main developments since Bekenstein’s original proposal1 1 Black hole entropy The idea that black holes have an entropy proportional to the area has been a remarkable realization [1]. It is a surprising confluence of statistical mechanics, quantum mechanics, special relativity and gravity. This can be seen clearly by restoring all the constants normally set to one in the black hole entropy formula [1, 2] The formula is most remarkable because a black hole is just a solution of the Einstein equations, which are classical2 . This formula, together with Einstein equations is consistent with the first law of thermodynamics [4]  where M is the mass of the black holes and T is the temperature of the black hole, given by Hawking’s formula [2]. The fact that the area of the horizon increases [5] is consistent with the 2nd law of thermodynamics [6]. It also shows that (1.1) is a coarse grained entropy, which is the kind of entropy that increases under the second law. These results show that black holes behave as ordinary thermal systems for an observer who remains outside the black hole. They further suggest that in the full quantum theory, an outside observer, could view the black hole as an ordinary quantum system. Finding ways to realize this idea was a central topic of research in the past forty years. Bekenstein proposed a generalized second law for the total entropy, given by the area of the horizon plus the entropy outside the horizon [6] The validity of this generalized second law seems to imply some constraints on the entropic content of matter [7]. This arises from a thought experiment involving matter falling into a black hole. If we call Sm the entropy of the in-falling matter, we find that the entropy of the outside decreased by Sm. However, the area of the black hole increased, as implied by (1.2), δSBH = δEm/T. So the generalized second law of thermodynamics would be obeyed if this later quantity is larger than Sm. This implies that there should be an upper bound on the entropy content in terms of the energy. Matter with some entropy should necessarily carry some energy. Now, this should hold for matter that is close to the black hole horizon. An important property of black holes is that the asymptotic time translation symmetry acts as a boost in the near horizon region. Namely, near the horizon we can define coordinates x where the radial and time direction has a usual flat space geometry The horizons are at x ± = 0 (past and future horizons). The  asymptotic time translation symmetry that shifts the asymptotic time t acts as a boost in the x ± plane. We can normalize the boost generator so that x + has eigenvalue one. In terms of Rindler coordinates,  the boost generator is conjugate to τ time translations. The time τ is related to the asymptotic time t by  where T is the Hawking temperature. The precise rescaling is obtained from the full black hole geometry and (1.4) is then the expression for the Hawking temperature in terms of the black hole parameters. In other words, in terms of the time τ the inverse Hawking temperature is 2π, so that the physical value of the temperature measured at infinity comes purely from the rescaling of the two time coordinates. The same rescaling factor appears in the energy measured with respect to time t versus the boost energy measured with respect to time τwhere B is the energy measured with respect to time τ , and is equal to the boost generator near the horizon. Then the necessary condition for obeying the second law is that where Bm is the boost eigenvalue of the matter. Bekenstein’s formulation of the bound involved bounding the entropy in terms of the energy and the size R of the system [7]. However, (1.6) is a more precise form of the bound, it is what can be proven and it is also what we need for the second law. It was suspected for many years that (1.6) would imply some restriction on the types of QFT that can be coupled to gravity. However, it was shown by Casini [8], building on previous ideas by [9, 10], that a version of (1.6) is actually true in any relativistic quantum field theory. Before discussing the proof, it is necessary to notice that (1.6) has an ~ in the left hand side. So the bound is trivially obeyed in the classical limit. In order to get close to saturating the bound it is necessary to consider quantum effects. In relativistic quantum field theory we cannot localize particles or excitations. Therefore, in order to talk about a bound like (1.6) we need to define things more precisely. In fact, the proper quantum version involves the Von Neumann entropy of the quantum field theory state restricted to the right Rindler wedge. This Von Neumann entropy is sometimes called “entanglement” entropy since it arises because we are dividing a pure state into two parts, one outside the horizon and the other inside. We can compute this entropy for the state in question, containing some matter, and we subtract the same quantity for the vacuum to form the difference ∆S. Then the bound is [8]  where ∆B is the expectation value of the Boost generator in the state in question minus its expectation value in the vacuum. There are divergencies when we compute the entropies but these cancel when we compute the differences. There can be some remaining ambiguities in the definition of the entropy but these are the same as the ambiguities defining the precise form of the boost generator on the half space. It turns out that (1.7) is the same as the positivity of relative entropy [8]. Equivalently, we can think of the vacuum as thermal state on the Rindler wedge. Then (1.7) reduces to the statement that the difference in free energy between the state in question and the vacuum is positive, which is true since the thermal equilibrium state minimizes the free energy. Another set of ideas that grew out of Bekenstein’s bound is summarized in [11], and will not be discussed here. In recent years the discussion of black hole thermodynamics has been extended to the semiclassical domain, where we consider also quantum fields and include their entropy. In that case, a more precise version of black hole entropy includes also the Von Neumann entropy of the quantum fields outside the black hole horizon [12] Stotal = (Area) 4GN + SV.N. + · · · (1.8) where the dots are some extra pieces that we will not discuss in detail here, having to do with extra Wald terms [13] and counterterms. This a more precise version of (1.3). It is the correct expression up to order G0 N in the semiclassical expansion. Note that while (1.1) depends only on gravity, (1.8) depends also on the type of matter fields that we have in the theory. Using the monotonicity of relative entropy, A. Wall, has argued [14] that the second law of black hole thermodynamics holds for (1.8). This shows that no new inequality is needed from matter other than the ones that follow from the fact that matter is described by relativistic quantum field theory. The fact that black hole entropy exists, and obeys the second law, can be viewed as evidence that black holes should have a unitary description as viewed from the outside. Otherwise, if unitarity were preserved only after adding a second asymptotic region beyond the horizon, then why couldn’t entropy simply disappear into that region? 2 The search for black hole microstates We can think of the formula for black hole entropy as a kind of “experimental” result, analogous to the entropy that an experimentalist would measure on a real world material by staring from zero temperature and putting in energy slowly to get it to a desired final sate, and computing the entropy from the first law. Since the work of Boltzmann we expect that entropy should be associated to the number of microstates of the system. So the question is: what are the microstates that give rise to the entropy of black holes?. One would expect that these microstates should be a fairly universal since, at leading order, the entropy is independent of the details of the matter theory. The most naive picture for these microstates comes from simply computing the Von Neumann entropy of the quantum fields outside the black hole. This gives a UV divergent quantity going like [12]  where  is the UV cutoff. We can view this as the entropy of the hot atmosphere near the black hole horizon. In the semiclassical approximation we should always choose the cutoff  to be larger than lP lanck. Therefore (2.9) is smaller than (1.1). However, this has not prevented speculation that perhaps by some suitable principle we would find a cutoff procedure that would reproduce the black hole entropy. The most precise ideas in this direction involve using a Pauli-Villars type regulator for the fields and viewing the Newton constant as arising as in induced gravity, see e.g. [15]. This has the drawback that the UV sensitive terms come from ghosts. A more correct and solid point of view is to think of (2.9) as part of a correction to black hole entropy and view the divergent term as a term that is cancelled by a similar renormalization of the Newton constant, which leads to a second area term included in the dots in (1.8) that cancels the divergent terms in (2.9). This cancellation is automatic when we compute the free energy and the entropy using euclidean methods [16]. But this still leaves us without a concrete picture for the microstates. Nevertheless it suggests that they are related to states that exist near the horizon and near the UV of the bulk. These are states that do not have an explicit, calculable description, within the regime that gravity is a good approximation. Of course, the black hole entropy formula still somehow “knows” about them. 2.1 Black hole entropy in string theory 2.2 Perturbative string theory The above discussion suggests that in a UV finite theory of gravity perhaps the Von Neumann entropy is finite and it accounts for the full entropy of the black hole. String theory is definitely UV finite [17]. Unfortunately, it is not know how to compute the Von Neumann entropy of a subregion. It had been speculated that perhaps the black hole entropy is related to the entropy of open strings ending on the horizon [18]. Though this is an attractive idea, to the best of my knowledge, there is no precise computation of the entropy along these lines. However, there are two more indirect approaches to compute black hole entropy in string theory which we discuss below. 2.2.1 Black hole entropy for supersymmetric black holes A very fruitful set up involves the computation of the entropy of extremal black holes in supersymmetric gravity theories arising from string theory compactifications [19]. Extremal black holes are a type of charged black hole. A non-singular charged black hole obeys the condition M ≥ Q (in some units). An extremal black hole obeys M = Q. In sufficiently supersymmetric theories this sometimes coincides with a BPS bound [20]. A BPS bound is a bound that arises from the supersymmetry algebra, and it also has the form M ≥ Q. States saturating this bound are specially protected, in the sense that supersymmetry implies that their number does not change when we change the coupling constants of the theory. By changing the coupling we can start with a black hole solution and turn it into in a weakly coupled collection of strings and D-branes [21]. We will not describe in detail what D-branes are. The important point is that they are objects that obey clear and simple rules. These objects can be assembled in a large number of quantum states, set by their total charge. For large charges, this number agrees precisely with the one expected from the Bekenstein-Hawking black hole entropy formula [19]. This counting has been done with increasing degree of precision. Quantum corrections as in (1.8) have been matched. Most recently it was understood how to perform the gravity computation in a non-perturbative fashion in order to reproduce the precise counting of microstates [22]. See [23] for a review and further references. Of course, such computations depend on the details of the theory because the entropy of black holes does indeed depend on the details when once we go beyond the area term. This has been a great success and it gives us confidence that string theory is a fully consistent theory of quantum gravity. 2.2.2 Black hole entropy from the gauge/gravity duality Black hole entropy can also be studied from the point of view of the gauge/gravity duality [24, 25, 26]. This is a relationship that equates gravity in asymptotically anti-de-Sitter (AdS) boundary conditions with a strongly coupled conformal field theory. A black hole in AdS is equated with a thermal state in the conformal field theory. This state is a hot fluid of strongly interacting particles. The entropy of the black hole is equated to the entropy of this fluid in the quantum field theory. In general, this is difficult to compute because the field theory is strongly coupled. A particularly simple case is the three dimensional case, AdS3. Here the boundary is 1 + 1 dimensional and the powerful conformal symmetry can be used to compute the thermal entropy as [27]where L is the size of the boundary region, T is the temperature and c is the so called central charge of the two dimensional conformal field theory. This central charge can be computed also in the gravity theory [28],So, one can start from the gravity theory, compute the central charge, assume that the theory has a unitary realization as a CFT and then compute the black hole entropy [29]. Another approach has been to compute the entropy (or energy) numerically in the quantum mechanical description [30]. This was done for an interacting matrix quantummechanics theory [31] that has a gravity dual [32]. This has the advantage of being a direct computation, without any reliance on conformal symmetry. In fact, this quantum mechanical model is not conformal invariant. A feature of these calculations is that they provide the entropy of the full spacetime, including both the black hole and the full spacetime outside. As presently understood, these formulas do not allow a clean separation between the black hole degrees of freedom and those of the outside region. 3 Fine grained gravitational entropy As we mentioned before, the entropy computed by the Bekenstein-Hawking formula should be interpreted as a coarse grained entropy, since it grows under time evolution, obeying the second law of thermodynamics. One can wonder whether there is any formula that computes the full von Neumann entropy of the microscopic density matrix. In fact, such a formula was proposed by Ryu and Takayanagi [33] and Hubeny- Rangamani-Takayanagi [34] (HRT). Their prescription is to find an extremal surface in the whole geometry. A surface which has minimal area on a given spacelike slice but has maximal area among all possible spacelike slices [35]. This prescription becomes particularly interesting for spacetimes containing a black hole which is connected through the interior to a second asymptotic region. An example is the standard eternal Schwarzschild black hole, which is the maximal analytic extension of the Schwarzschild solution containing two asymptotic regions, see figure 1(a). These configurations can be viewed as entangled black holes [36, 37]. In this case the extremal surface is the bifurcation surface and it sits at the horizon. A more interesting case arises when we consider a deformation of this geometry obtained by adding matter that falls into the two black holes, see figure 1(b). In this case the Penrose diagram becomes more elongated and the extremal surface area is smaller than the area of the horizon. Furthermore, the extremal surface is a property of the full spacetime geometry. Therefore, it is time independent, a fact which is related to the constancy of the fine grained entropy of the system under unitary evolution. An interesting aspect of the extremal surface (or HRT) surface is that it typically sits behind the event horizon, see figure 1(b). The HRT formula is even more remarkable that the Bekenstein-Hakwing formula because it knows about the microscopic entropy of the system. In other words, one might think that gravity is “just” a hydrodynamic or thermodynamic approximation to the exact system. However, the HRT formula shows that gravity knows about the microscopic von Neumann entropy of the system. In the context of holography, the HRT formula can be used to compute the entanglement entropy of subregions of the boundary quantum field theory. This has been useful for two reasons. First, it has provided a tool for studying the entanglement patterns of strongly coupled field theories. The lessons from these holographic theories serve as interesting examples in order to understand the problem in more general theories. Second, the fact that the entropy is given by a simple geometric quantity suggests that entanglement plays a crucial role in determining the geometry of spacetime. Figure 1: (a) The Penrose diagram of the eternal Schwarzschild solution. It has the geometry of a non-traversable wormhole connecting two regions that look like the exterior geometry of a black hole. These regions are sharing the interior regions. In this case, the extremal surface E sits at the event horizon H, whose area is time independent. (b) We consider a configuration where we add extra matter falling into the black holes, represented here by the arrows. Now the event horizon area is a minimum at He and grows towards its late times Hl , with AHl > AHe as implied by the area theorem. The extremal surface is inside the wormhole and has a smaller area AE < AHe < AHl . 4 Conclusions Black hole entropy has been a central object of interest in the exploration of quantum aspects of gravity. The generalized entropy was defined in the quantum theory and the generalized second law was proven. This proof works for any matter theory described by relativistic quantum field theory, no further constraint on matter was necessary. In particular, a version of the Bekenstein bound (1.7) is automatically obeyed for any quantum field theory. Through string theory we can now identify the black hole microstates. There are two broad ways to do this. One involves supersymmetric black holes, where one can count the states by going to a weakly coupled limit without losing any states. The other involves black holes in special spaces, such as anti-de-Sitter spacetimes, where one can find a dual formulation in terms of a strongly interacting theory on the boundary. In this case, the black hole looks like a hot fluid on the boundary theory and the entropy is the entropy of this fluid. This describes the entropy of both the black hole and the spacetime around it. This boundary description is manifestly unitary. So, if we believe the duality we conclude that black holes preserve information. The entropy defined in terms of the area of the event horizon is a coarse grained entropy. A fined grained notion of entanglement entropy was also recently defined [33, 34] and has become a very useful window into the quantum mechanics of spacetime. An important open problem is to describe the black hole interior in the full quantum theory. In other words, we would like to be able to describe the interior using the same variables in which we describe the microstates with their unitary dynamics. In fact, several paradoxes arise in some naive approaches to this problem [38, 39].		Juan Maldacena

The evidence for the conjecture consists of several correspondences between the two theories. As a consequence of supersymmetry the simple matrix model is rich enough to describe the properties of the entire Fock space of massless well separated particles of the supergravity theory. In one particular kinematic situation the leading large distance interaction of these particles is exactly described by supergravity . The model appears to be a nonperturbative realization of the holographic principle. The membrane states required by M-theory are contained as excitations of the matrix model. The membrane world volume is a noncommutative geometry embedded in a noncommutative spacetime. 1. Introduction M theory [1] is the strongly coupled limit of type IIA string theory. In the limit of infinite coupling it becomes an eleven dimensional theory in a background infinite flat space. In this paper M-theory will always refer to this decompactified limit. We know very little about this theory except for the following two facts. At low energy and large distances it is described by eleven dimensional supergravity . It is also known to possess membrane degrees of freedom with membrane tension  where lp is the eleven dimensional Planck length. It seems extremely unlikely that M-theory is any kind of conventional quantum field theory. The degrees of freedom describing the short distance behavior are simply unknown. The purpose of this paper is to put forward conjecture about these degrees of freedom and about the Hamiltonian governing them. The conjecture grew out of a number of disparate facts about M-theory , D branes [2], matrix descriptions of their dynamics [3], supermembranes [4,5,6], the holographic principle [7], and short distance phenomena in string theory [8,9]. Simply stated the conjecture is this. M-theory , in the light cone frame, is exactly described by the large N limit of a particular supersymmetric matrix quantum mechanics. The system is the same one that has been used previously used to study the small distance behavior of D0 branes [9]. P.K. Townsend [10] was the first to point out that the supermatrix formulation of membrane theory suggested that membranes could be viewed as composites of D0 branes. Our work is a precise realization of his suggestion. In what follows we will present our conjecture and some evidence for it. We begin by reviewing the description of string theory in the infinite momentum frame. We then present our conjecture for the full set of degrees of freedom of M-theory and the Hamiltonian which governs them. Our strongest evidence for the conjecture is a demonstration that our model contains the excitations which are widely believed to exist in M-theory , supergravitons and large metastable classical membranes. These are discussed in sections 3 and 5. The way in which these excitations arise is somewhat miraculous, and we consider this to be the core evidence for our conjecture. In section 4 we present a calculation of supergraviton scattering in a very special kinematic region, and argue that our model reproduces the expected result of low energy supergravity. The calculation depends on a supersymmetric nonrenormalization theorem whose validity we will discuss there. In section 6 we argue that our model may satisfy the Holographic Principle. This raises crucial issues about Lorentz invariance which are discussed there. 1 We emphasize that there are many unanswered questions about our proposed version of M-theory. Nonetheless these ideas seem of sufficient interest to warrant presenting them here. If our conjecture is correct, this would be the first nonperturbative formulation of a quantum theory which includes gravity. 2. The infinite momentum frame and the Holographic Principle The infinite momentum frame [11] is the old name for the misnamed light cone frame. Thus far this is the only frame in which it has proved possible to formulate string theory in Hamiltonian form. The description of M-theory which we will give in this paper is also in the infinite momentum frame . We will begin by reviewing some of the features of the infinite momentum frame formulation of relativistic quantum mechanics. For a comprehensive review we refer the reader to [11]. We begin by choosing a particular spatial direction x  where a labels the particle. The system is boosted along the x  axis until all longitudinal momenta are much larger than any scale in the problem. Further longitudinal boosting just rescales all longitudinal momenta in fixed proportion. Quantum field theory in such a limiting reference frame has a number of properties which will be relevant to us. It is convenient to begin by assuming the x 11 direction is compact with a radius R. The compactification serves as an infrared cutoff. Accordingly, the longitudinal momentum of any system or subsystem of quanta is quantized in units of 1/R. In the infinite momentum frame all systems are composed of constituent quanta or partons. The partons all carry strictly positive values of longitudinal momentum. It is particularly important to understand what happens to quanta of negative or vanishing p11. The answer is that as the infinite momentum limit is approached the frequency of these quanta, relative to the Lorentz time dilated motion of the boosted system becomes infinite and the zero and negative momentum quanta may be integrated out. The process of integrating out such fast modes may influence or even determine the Hamiltonian of the remaining modes. In fact the situation is slightly more complicated in certain cases for the zero momentum degrees of freedom. In certain situations such as spontaneous symmetry breaking, these longitudinally homogeneous modes define backgrounds whose moduli may appear in the 2 Hamiltonian of the other modes. In any case the zero and negative momentum modes do not appear as independent dynamical degrees of freeedom. Thus we may assume all systems have longitudinal momentum given by an integer multiple of 1/R with N strictly positive. At the end of a calculation we must let R and N/R tend to infinity to get to the uncompactified infinite momentum limit. The main reason for the simplifying features of the infinite momentum frame is the existence of a transverse Galilean symmetry which leads to a naive nonrelativistic form for the equations. The role of nonrelativistic mass is played by the longitudinal momentum p11. The Galilean transformations take the form As an example of the Galilean structure of the equations, the energy of a free massless particle isFor the eleven dimensional supersymmetric theory we will consider, the Galilean invariance is extended to the Supergalilean group which includes 32 real supergenerators. The supergenerators divide into two groupsThe Lorentz generators which do not preserve the infinite momentum frame mix up the two kinds of generators. Let us now recall some of the features of string theory in the infinite momentum or light cone frame [12]. We will continue to call the longitudinal direction x 11 even though in this case the theory has only ten space-time directions. The transverse space is of course eight dimensional. To describe a free string of longitudinal momentum p11 a periodic parameter σ which runs from 0 to p11 is introduced. To regulate the world sheet theory a cutoff δσ = ǫ is introduced. This divides the parameter space into N = p11/ǫ segmentseach carrying longitudinal momentum ǫ. We may think of each segment as a parton but unlike the partons of quantum field theory these objects always carry p11 = ǫ. For a multi particle system of total longitudinal momentum p11(total) we introduce a total parameter space of overall length p11(total) which we allow to be divided into separate pieces, each describing a string. The world sheet regulator is implemented by requiring each string to be composed of an integer number of partons of momentum ǫ. Interactions are described by splitting and joining processes in which the number of partons is strictly conserved. The regulated theory is thus seen to be a special case of Galilean quantum mechanics of N partons with interactions which bind them into long chains and allow particular kinds of rearrangements. The introduction of a minimum unit of momentum ǫ can be given an interpretation as an infrared cutoff. In particular we may assume that the x 11 coordinate is periodic with length . Evidently the physical limit is a limit in which the number of partons N tends to infinity. It is well known [7] that in this large N limit the partons become infinitely dense in the transverse space and that this leads to extremely strong interactions. This circumstance together with the Bekenstein bound on entropy, has led to the holographic speculation that the transverse density of partons is strictly bounded to about one per transverse Planck area. In other words the partons form a kind of incompressible fluid. This leads to the unusual consequence that the transverse area occupied by a system of longitudinal momentum p11 can not be smaller than p11/ǫ in Planck units. The general arguments for the holographic behavior of systems followed from considerations involving the Bekenstein - ’t Hooft bound on the entropy of a spatial region [13] and were not specific to string theory. If the arguments are correct they should also apply to 11 dimensional theories which include gravitation. Thus we should expect that in M-theory the radius of a particle such as the graviton will grow with p11 according to where lp is the eleven dimensional Planck length. In what follows we will see quantitative evidence for exactly this behavior. At first sight the holographic growth of particles appears to contradict the boost invariance of particle interactions. Consider the situation of two low energy particles moving past one another with some large transverse separation, let us say of order a  meter. Obviously these particles have negligible interactions. Now boost the system along the longitudinal direction until the size of each particle exceeds their separation. They now overlap as they pass each other. But longitudinal boost invariance requires that the scattering amplitude is still essentially zero. This would seem to require extremely special and unnatural cancellations. We will see below that one key to this behavior is the very special BPS property of the partons describing M-theory. However, we are far from having a complete understanding of the longitudinal boost invariance of our system. Indeed, we view it as the key dynamical puzzle which must be unravelled in understanding the dynamics of M-theory. 3. M-theory and D0 branes M-theory with a compactified longitudinal coordinate x 11 is by definition type IIA string theory. The correspondences between the two theories include [1] : 1. The compactification radius R is related to the string coupling constant by2. The Ramond-Ramond photon of IIA theory is the Kaluza Klein photon which arises upon compactification of eleven dimensional supergravity. 3. No perturbative string states carry RR charge. In other words all perturbative string states carry vanishing momentum along the x 11 direction. The only objects in the theory which do carry RR photon charge are the D0 branes of Polchinski. D0 branes are point particles which carry a single unit of RR charge. Equivalently they carry longitudinal momentumThe D0 branes carry the quantum numbers of the first massive KK modes of the basic eleven dimensional supergravity multiplet, including 44 gravitons, 84 components of a 3-form, and 128 gravitinos. We will refer to these particles as supergravitons. As 11- dimensional objects these are all massless. As a consequence they are BPS saturated states in the 10-dimensional theory. Their 10-D mass is 1/R. 5 4. Supergravitons carrying Kaluza Klein momentum p11 = N/R also exist but are not described as elementary D0 branes. As shown in [3] their proper description is as bound composites of N D0 branes. These properties make the D0 branes candidate partons for an infinite momentum limit description of M-theory. We expect that if, as in quantum field theory, the degrees of freedom with vanishing and negative p11 decouple then M-theory in the infinite momentum frame should be a theory whose only degrees of freedom are D0 branes. Anti-D0 branes carry negative Kaluza Klein momenta and strings carry vanishing p11. The decoupling of anti-D0 branes is particularly fortunate because brane anti-brane dynamics is something about which we know very little [14]. The BPS property of zero branes ameliorates the conflict between infinitely growing parton wave functions and low energy locality which we noted at the end of the last section. We will see some partial evidence for this in a nontrivial scattering computation below. We will also discuss below the important point that a model containing only D0 branes actually contains large classical supermembrane excitations. Since the conventional story of the M theoretic origin of strings depicts them as membranes wrapped around the compactified eleventh dimension, we have some reason to believe that strings have not really been left out of the system. All of these circumstances lead us to propose that M-theory in the infinite momentum frame is a theory in which the only dynamical degrees of freedom or partons are D0 branes. Furthermore it is clear in this case that all systems are built out of composites of partons, each of which carries the minimal p11. We note however that our system does have a set of degrees of freedom which go beyond the parton coordinates. Indeed, as first advocated in [3], the D0 brane coordinates of N partons have to be promoted to matrices. At distance scales larger than the eleven dimensional Planck scale, these degrees of freedom become very massive and largely decouple1 , but their virtual effects are responsible for all parton interactions. These degrees of freedom are BPS states, and are related to the parton coordinates by gauge transformations. Furthermore, when the partons are close together they become low frequency modes. Thus they cannot be omitted in any discussion of the dynamics of D0 branes . 4. D0 brane Mechanics If the infinite momentum limit of M-theory is the theory of D0 branes, decoupled from the other string theory degrees of freedom, what is the precise form of the quantum mechanics of the system? Fortunately there is a very good candidate which has been extensively studied in another context in which D0 branes decouple from strings [9]. As emphasized at the end of the last section, open strings which connect D0 branes do not exactly decouple. In fact the very short strings which connect the branes when they are practically on top of each other introduce a new kind of coordinate space in which the nine spatial coordinates of a system of N D0 branes become nine N ×N matrices, Xi a,b [3]. The matrices X are accompanied by 16 fermionic superpartners θa,b which transform as spinors under the SO(9) group of transverse rotations. The matrices may be thought of as the spatial components of 10 dimensional Super Yang Mills (SYM) fields after dimensional reduction to zero space directions. These Yang Mills fields describe the open strings which are attached to the D0 branes. The Yang Mills quantum mechanics has U(N) symmetry and is described (in units with ls = 1) by the LagrangianHere we have used conventions in which the fermionic variables are 16 component nine dimensional spinors. In [9] this Lagrangian was used to to study the short distance properties of D0 branes in weakly coupled string theory. The 11-D Planck length emerged as a natural dynamical length scale in that work, indicating that the system (4.1) describes some M-theoretic physics. In [9] (4.1) was studied as a low velocity effective theory appropriate to the heavy D0 branes of weakly coupled string theory. Here we propose (4.1) as the most general infinite momentum frame Lagrangian, with at most two derivatives which is invariant under the gauge symmetry and the Supergalilean group [15]2 . It would be consistent with our assumption that matrix D0 branes are the only degrees of freedom of M-theory , to write a Lagrangian with higher powers of first derivatives. We do not know if any such Lagrangians exist which preserve the full symmetry of the infinite momentum frame . What is at issue here is eleven dimensional Lorentz invariance. In typical infinite momentum frame field theories, the naive classical Lagrangian for the positive longitudinal momentum modes is renormalized by the decoupled infinite frequency modes. The criterion which determines the infinite momentum frame Lagrangian is invariance under longitudinal boosts and null plane rotating Lorentz tranformations (the infamous angular conditions). Apart from simplicity, our main reason for suggesting the Lagrangian (4.1) is that we have found some partial evidence that the large N limit of the quantum theory it defines is indeed Lorentz invariant. A possible line of argument systematically leading to (4.1) is discussed in Section 9. Following [9] , let us rewrite the action in units in which the 11-D Planck length is 1. Using (3.1) and (3.2) the change of units is easily made and one finds where Y =  . We have also changed the units of time to 11-D Planck units. We have restored the gauge field (∂t → Dt = ∂t + iA) to this expression (previously we were in A = 0 gauge) in order to emphasize that the SUSY transformation laws (here ǫ and ǫ ′ are two independent 16 component anticommuting SUSY parameters), of 16, each transforming as spinors under the nine dimensional transverse rotation group. We denote them by Qα and qA and they obey anticommutation relations  involve a gauge transformation. As a result, the SUSY algebra closes on the gauge generators, and only takes on the form (2.4) when applied to gauge invariant states. The Hamiltonian has the form where Π is the canonical conjugate to Y . Note that in the limit R → ∞, all finite energy states of this Hamiltonian have infinite energy. We will be interested only in states whose energy vanishes like 1 N in the large N limit, so that this factor becomes the inverse power of longitudinal momentum which we expect for the eigenstates of a longitudinal boost invariant system. Thus, in the correct infinite momentum frame limit, the only relevantasymptotic states of the Hamiltonian should be those whose energy is of order 1 N . We will exhibit a class of such states below, the supergraviton scattering states. The difficult thing will be to prove that their S-matrix elements depend only on ratios of longitudinal momenta, so that they are longitudinally boost invariant. To understand how this system represents ordinary particles we note that when the ome large the commutator term in H becomes very costly in energy. Therefore for large distances the finite energy configurations lie on the flat directions along which the commutators vanish. In this system with 16 supercharges, 3 these classical zero energy states are in fact exact supersymmetric states of the system. In contrast to field theory, the continuous parameters which describe these states (the Higgs VEVs in the language of SYM theory) are not vacuum superselection parameters, but rather collective coordinates. We must compute their quantum wave functions rather than freeze them at classical values. They are however the slowest modes in the system, so that we can integrate out the other degrees of freedom to get an effective SUSY quantum mechanics of these modes alone. We will study some aspects of this effective dynamics below. Along the flat directions the Y i are simultaneously diagonalizable. The diagonal matrix elements are the coordinates of the D0 branes. When the Y are small the cost in energy for a noncommuting configuration is not large. Thus for small distances there is no interpretation of the configuration space in terms of ordinary positions. Classical geometry and distance are only sensible concepts in this system in regions far out along one of the flat directions. We will refer to this as the long distance regime. In the short distance regime, we have a noncommutative geometry. Nevertheless the full Hamiltonian (4.6) has the usual Galilean symmetry. To see this we define the center of mass of the system by A transverse translation is defined by adding a multiple of the identity to Y . This has no effect on the commutator term in L because the identity commutes with all Y . Similarly rotational invariance is manifest. The center of mass momentum is given byA Galilean boost is defined by adding a multiple of the identity to Y˙ . We leave it to the reader to show that this has no effect on the equations of motion. This establishes the Galilean invariance of H. The Supergalilean invariance is also completely unbroken. The alert reader may be somewhat unimpressed by some of these invariances, since they appear to be properties of the center of mass coordinate, which decouples from the rest of the dynamics. Their real significance will appear below when we show that our system possesses multiparticle asymptotic states, on which these generators act in the usual way as a sum of single particle operators. 5. A Conjecture Our conjecture is thus that M-theory formulated in the infinite momentum frame is exactly equivalent to the N → ∞ limit of the supersymmetric quantum mechanics described by the Hamiltonian (4.6). The calculation of any physical quantity in M-theory can be reduced to a calculation in matrix quantum mechanics followed by an extrapolation to large N. In what follows we will offer evidence for this surprising conjecture. Let us begin by examining the single particle spectrum of the theory. For N = 1 the states with p⊥ = 0 are just those of a single D0 brane at rest. The states form a representation of the algebra of the 16 θ ′ s with 28 components. These states have exactly the quantum numbers of the 256 states of the supergraviton. For non-zero p⊥ the energy of the object is  The Hamiltonian for the relative motion is the dimensional reduction of the supersymmetric 10-D Yang Mills Hamiltonian. Although a direct proof based on the Schroedinger equation has not yet been given, duality detween IIA strings and M-theory requires the relative Schroedinger equation to have normalizable threshold bound states with zero energy [3]. The bound system must have exactly the quantum numbers of the 256 states of the supergraviton. For these states the complete energy is given by (5.4). Furthermore these states are BPS saturated. No other normalizable bound states can occur. Thus we find that the spectrum of stable single particle excitations of (4.6) is exactly the supergraviton spectrum with the correct dispersion relation to describe massless 11 dimensional particles in the infinite momentum frame. Next let us turn to the spectrum of widely separated particles. That a simple quantum mechanical Hamiltonian like (4.6) should be able to describe arbitrarily many well separated particles is not at all evident and would certainly be impossible without the special properties implied by supersymmetry. Begin by considering commuting block diagonal matrices of the form  a are Na × Na matrices and N1 + N2 +. . .+ Nn = N. For the moment suppose all other elements of the Y ′ s are constrained to vanish identically. In this case the Schroedinger equation obviously separates into n uncoupled Schroedinger equations for the individual block degrees of freedom. Each equation is identical to the original Schroedinger equation for the system of Na D0 branes. Thus the spectrum of this truncated system includes collections of noninteracting supergravitons. Now let us suppose the supergravitons are very distant from one another. In other words for each pair the relative distance, defined by  is asymptotically large. In this case the commutator terms in (4.6) cause the off diagonal blocks in the Y ′ s to have very large potential energy proportional to R2 a,b. This effect 11 can also be thought of as the Higgs effect giving mass to the broken generators (“Wbosons”) of U(N) when the symmetry is broken to U(N1) × U(N2) × U(N3). . .. Thus one might naively expect the off diagonal modes to leave the spectrum of very widely separated supergravitons unmodified. However this is not correct in a generic situation. The off diagonal modes behave like harmonic oscillators with frequency of order Ra,b and their zero point energy will generally give rise to a potential energy of similar magnitude. This effect would certainly preclude an interpretation of the matrix model in terms of well separated independent particles. Supersymmetry is the ingredient which rescues us. In a well known way the fermionic partners of the off diagonal bosonic modes exactly cancel the potential due to the bosons, leaving exactly flat directions. We know this from the nonrenormalization theorems for supersymmetric quantum mechanics with 16 supergenerators [15]. The effective Lagrangian for the collective coordinates along the flat directions must be supersymmetric and the result of [15] guarantees that up to terms involving at most two derivatives, the Lagrangian for these coordinates must be the dimensional reduction of U(1)n SYM theory, where n is the number of blocks (i.e. the number of supergravitons). This is just the Lagrangian for free motion of these particles. Furthermore, since we are doing quantum mechanics, and the analog of the Yang Mills coupling is the dimensional quantity l 3 p , the coefficient of the quadratic term is uncorrected from its value in the original Lagrangian. There are residual virtual effects at order p 4 from these heavy states which are the source of parton interactions. Note that the off diagonal modes are manifestly nonlocal. The apparent locality of low energy physics in this model must emerge from a complex interplay between SUSY and the fact that the frequencies of the nonlocal degrees of freedom become large when particles are separated. We have only a limited understanding of this crucial issue, but in the next section we will provide some evidence that local physics is reproduced in the low energy, long distance limit. The center of mass of a block of size N(a) is defined by equation (5.2) . It is easy to see that the Hamiltonian for an asymptotic multiparticle state, when written in terms of center of mass transverse momenta, is just  Note that the dispersion relation for the asymptotic particle states has the fully eleven dimensional Lorentz invariant form. This is essentially due to the BPS nature of the 12 asymptotic states. For large relative separations, the supersymmetric quantum state corresponding to the supersymmetric classical flat direction in which the gauge symmetry is “broken”into n blocks, will be precisely the product of the threshold boundstate wave functions of each block subsystem. Each individual block is a BPS state. Its dispersion relation follows from the SUSY algebra and is relativistically invariant even when (e.g. for finite N) the full system is not. We also note that the statistics of multi supergraviton states comes out correctly because of the residual block permutation gauge symmetry of the matrix model. When some subset of the blocks are in identical states, the original gauge symmetry instructs us to mod out by the permutation group, picking up minus signs depending on whether the states are constructed from an odd or even number of Grassmann variables. The spin statistics connection is the conventional one. Thus, the large N matrix model contains the Fock space of asymptotic states of eleven dimensional supergravity, and the free propagation of particles is described in a manner consistent with eleven dimensional Lorentz invariance. The field theory Fock space is however embedded in a system which, as we shall see, has no ultraviolet divergences. Particle statistics is embedded in a continuous gauge symmetry. We find the emergence of field theory as an approximation to an elegant finite structure one of the most attractive features of the matrix model approach to M-theory. 6. Long Range Supergraviton Interactions The first uncancelled interactions in the matrix model occur in the effective action at order ˙y 4 where ˙y is the velocity of the supergravitons [9]. These interactions are calculated by thinking of the matrix model as SYM theory and computing Feynman diagrams. At one loop one finds an induced quartic term in the velocities which corresponds to an induced  where r is the distance between the D0 branes and A is a coefficient of order one which can be extracted from the results of [9]. This is the longest range term which governs the interaction between the D0 branes as r tends to infinity. Thus the effective Lagrangian governing the low energy long distance behavior of the pair is From (6.4) we can compute a scattering amplitude in Born approximation. Strictly speaking the scattering amplitude is defined as a 10-D amplitude in the compactified theory. However it contains information about the 11-D amplitude in the special kinematic situation where no longitudinal momentum is exchanged. The relation between the 10-D amplitude and 11-D amplitude at vanishing ∆p11 is simple. They are essentially the same thing except for a factor of R which is needed to relate the 10 and 11 dimensional phase space volumes. The relation between amplitudes is A11 = RA10. Thus from (6.4) we find the 11-D amplitudeThe expression in (6.5) is noteworthy for several reasons. First of all the factor r −7 is the 11-D green function (in space) after integration over x 11. In other words it is the scalar Feynman propagator for vanishing longitudinal momentum transfer. Somehow the simple matrix Hamiltonian knows about massless propagation in 11-D spacetime. The remaining momentum dependent factors are exactly what is needed to make (6.5) identical to the single (super) graviton exchange diagram in 11-D.4 Even the coefficient is correct. This is closely related to a result reported in [9] where it was shown that the annulus diagram governing the scattering of two D0 branes has exactly the same form at very small and very large distances, which can be understood by noting that only BPS states contribute to this process on the annulus. This, plus the usual relations between couplings and scales in Type IIA string theory and M-theory guarantee that we obtain the correct normalization of eleven dimensional graviton scattering in SUGRA. In the weak coupling limit, very long distance behavior is governed by single supergraviton exchange while the ultra short distances are governed by the matrix model. In [9] the exact equivalence between the leading interactions computed in these very different manners was recognized but its meaning was not clear. Now we see that it is an important consistency criterion in order for the matrix model to describe the infinite momentum limit of M-theory. Let us next consider possible corrections to the effective action coming from higher loops. In particular, higher loops can potentially correct the quartic term in velocities. Since our interest lies in the large N limit we may consider the leading (planar) corrections. Doing ordinary large N counting one finds that the ˙y 4 term may be corrected by a factor which is a function of the ratio N/r3 . Such a renormalization by f(N/r3 ) could be dangerous. We can consider several cases which differ in the behavior of f as N r 3 tends to infinity. In the first two the function tends to zero or infinity. The meaning of this would be that the coupling to gravity is driven either to zero or infinity in the infinite momentum limit. Either behavior is intolerable. Another possibility is that the function f tends to a constant not equal to 1. In this case the gravitational coupling constant is renormalized by a constant factor. This is not supposed to occur in M-theory. Indeed supersymmetry is believed to protect the gravitational coupling from any corrections. The only other possibility is that f → 1. The simplest way in which this can happen is if there are no corrections at all other than the one loop term which we have discussed. We believe that there is a nonrenormalization theorem for this term which can be proven in the context of SUSY quantum mechanics with 16 generators. The closest thing we have been able to find in the literature is a nonrenormalization theorem for the Fµν 4 term in the action of ten dimensional string theory5 which has been proven by Tseytlin [16]. the quantum mechanical context, we believe that it is true and that the scattering of two supergravitons at large transverse distance and zero longitudinal momentum is exactly given in the matrix model by low energy 11-D supergravity perturbation theory. M. Dine[17] has constructed the outlines of an argument which demonstrates the validity of the nonrenormalization theorem. We have considered amplitudes in which vanishing longitudinal momentum is exchanged. Amplitudes with nonvanishing exchange of p11 are more complicated. They correspond to processes in 10-D in which RR charge is exchanged. Such collisions involve rearrangements of the D0 branes in which the collision transfers D0 branes from one group to the other. We are studying such processes but we have no definitive results as yet. We have thus presented some evidence that the dynamics of the matrix model respects eleven dimensional Lorentz invariance. If this is correct then the model reduces exactly to supergravity at low energies. It is clear however that it is much better behaved in the ultraviolet than a field theory. At short distances, as shown extensively in [9] restoration of the full matrix character of the variables cuts off all ultraviolet divergences. The correspondence limit by which M-theory reduces to supergravity indicates that we are on the right track. 7. The Size of a Supergraviton As we have pointed out in section 2 the holographic principle requires the transverse size of a system to grow with the number of constituent partons. It is therefore of interest to estimate the size of the threshold bound state describing a supergraviton of longitudinal momentum N/R. According to the holographic principle the radius should grow like N1/9 in 11-D Planck units. We will use a mean field approximation in which we study the wave function of one parton in the field of N others. We therefore consider the effective Lagrangian (6.3) for the case N1 = 1, N2 = N. The action simplifies for N >> 1 since in this case the N particle system is much heavier than the single particle. Therefore we may set its velocity to zero. The Lagrangian becomes  That the size of the bound state wave function scales like N1/9 is an indication of the incompressibility of the system when it achieves a density of order one degree of freedom per Planck area. This is in accord with the holographic principle. This mean field picture of the bound state, or any other description of it as a simple cluster, makes the problem of longitudinal boost invariance mentioned earlier very concrete. Suppose we consider the scattering of two bound states with N1 and N2 constituents respectively, N1 ∼ N2 ∼ N. The mean field picture strongly suggests that scattering will show a characteristic feature at an impact parameter corresponding to the bound state size ∼ N1/9	We suggest and motivate a precise equivalence between uncompactified eleven dimensional M-theory and the N = ∞ limit of the supersymmetric matrix quantum mechanics describing D0 branes . The evidence for the conjecture consists of several correspondences between the two theories. As a consequence of supersymmetry the simple matrix model is rich enough to describe the properties of the entire Fock space of massless well separated particles of the supergravity theory. In one particular kinematic situation the leading large distance interaction of these particles is exactly described by supergravity . The model appears to be a nonperturbative realization of the holographic principle. The membrane states required by M-theory are contained as excitations of the matrix model. The membrane world volume is a noncommutative geometry embedded in a noncommutative spacetime.	T. Banks 1 , W. Fischler 2 , S.H. Shenker 1 , L. Susskind 3
30	Paper21_2	1997	M Theory As A Matrix Model: A Conjecture	 But this is not consistent with longitudinal boosts which take N1 → αN1, N2 → αN2. Boost invariance requires physics to depend only on the ratio N1/N2, or said another way, only on the ratio of the bound state sizes. This strongly suggests that a kind of scale invariance must be present in the dynamics that is clearly absent in the simple picture discussed above. In the string case the scale invariant world sheet dynamics is crucial for longitudinal boost invariance. The possibility that partons might form subclusters within the bound state was ignored in mean field discussion. A preliminary discussion of a hierarchical clustering model with many length scales is presented in the Appendix. Note also that wavefunctions of threshold bound states are power law behaved. Understanding the dynamics of these bound states well enough to check longitudinal boost invariance reliably is an important subject for future research. 8. Membranes In order to be the strong coupling theory of IIA string theory, M-theory must have membranes in its spectrum. Although in the decompactified limit there are no truly stable finite energy membranes, very long lived large classical membranes must exist. In this section we will show how these membranes are described in the matrix model, a result first found in [5]6 . Townsend[10] first pointed out the connection between the matrix description of D0 brane dynamics and the matrix description of membranes, and speculated that a membrane might be regarded as a collective excitation of D0 branes. Our conjecture supplies a precise realization of Townsend’s idea. The formulation we will use to describe this connection is a version of the methods introduced in [5,18,19] . Begin with a pair of unitary operators U, V satisfying the relations From (8.2) we see that only periodic functions of p and q are allowed. Thus the space defined by these variables is a torus. In fact there is an illuminating interpretation of these coordinates in terms of the quantum mechanics of particles on a torus in a strong background magnetic field. The coordinates of the particle are p, q. If the field is strong enough the existence of a large gap makes it useful to truncate the space of states to the finite dimensional subspace of lowest Landau levels. On this subspace the commutation relations (8.4) are satisfied. The lowest Landau wave packets form minimum uncertainty packets which occupy an area ∼ 1/N on the torus. These wave packets are analogous to the “Planckian cells” which make up quantum phase space. The p, q space is sometimes called the noncommuting torus, the quantum torus or the fuzzy torus . In fact, for large enough N we can choose other bases of N dimensional Hilbert space which correspond to the lowest Landau levels of a charged particle propagating on an arbitrary Riemann surface wrapped by a constant magnetic field. For example in [5], de Wit et al. construct the finite dimensional Hilbert space of lowest Landau levels on a sphere. This connection between finite matrix models and two dimensional surfaces is the basis for the fact that the large N matrix model contains membranes. For finite N, the model consists of maps of quantum Riemann surfaces into a noncommuting transverse superspace, i.e. it is a model of a noncommuting membrane embedded in a noncommutative space 7 . In the limit of large N the quantum torus behaves more and more like classical phase space. The following correspondences connect the two: 1. The quantum operators Z defined in (8.2) are replaced by their classical counterparts. Eq. (8.2) becomes the classical Fourier decomposition of a function on phase space. 2. The operation of taking the trace of an operator goes over to N times the integral over the torus. trZ → N Z Z(p, q)dpdq (8.5) 3. The operation of commuting two operators is replaced by 1/N times the classical Poisson bracket [Z, W] →  We may now use the above correspondence to formally rewrite the matrix model Lagrangian. We begin by representing the matrices Y i and θ as operator functions Now apply the correspondences to the two terms in (4.2). This gives Equation (8.8) is exactly the standard Hamiltonian for the 11-D supermembrane in the light cone frame. The construction shows us how to build configurations in the matrix model which represent large classical membranes. To do so we start with a classical embedding of a toroidal membrane described by periodic functions Y i (p, q). The Fourier expansion of these functions provides us with a set of coefficients Y i mn. Using (8.2) we then replace the classical Y ′ s by operator functions of U, V . The resulting matrices represent the large classical membranes. If the matrix model membranes described above are to correspond to M-theory membranes their tensions must agree. Testing this involves keeping track of the numerical factors of order one in the above discussion. We present this calculation in Appendix B where we show that the matrix model membrane tension exactly agrees with the Mtheory membrane tension. This has also been verified by Berkooz and Douglas [20] using a different technique. We do not expect static finite energy membranes to exist in the uncompactified limit. Nevertheless let us consider the conditions for such a static solution. The matrix model equations of motion for static configurations is with all other Y i = 0. Ri is the length of the corresponding direction, which should of course be taken to infinity. Since [Y  ] is a c-number, eq (8.9) is satisfied. Thus we find the necessary macroscopic membranes require by M-theory. This stretched membrane has the requisite “wrapping number” on the infinite plane. On a general manifold one might expect the matrix model version of the wrapping number of a membrane on a two cycle to be  where ω is the two form associated to the cycle. This expression approaches the classical winding number as we take the limit in which Poisson brackets replace commutators. Another indication that we have found the right representation of the membrane comes from studying the supersymmetry transformation properties of our configuration8 . The supermembrane should preserve half of the supersymmetries of the model. The SUSY transformation of the fermionic coordinates is  For our static membrane configuration, P i = 0, and the commutator is proportional to the unit matrix, so we can choose ǫ ′ to make this variation vanish. The unbroken supergenerators are linear combinations of the IMF qA and Qα. It is interesting to contempate a kind of duality and complementarity between membranes and D0 branes. According to the standard light cone quantization of membranes, the longitudinal momentum p11 is uniformly distributed over the area of the p, q parameter space. This is analogous to the uniform distribution of p11 along the σ axis is string theory. As we have seen the p, q space is a noncommuting space with a basic indivisible quantum of area. The longitudinal momentum of such a unit cell is 1/N of the total. In other words the unit phase space cells that result from the noncommutative structure of p, q space are the D0 branes with which we began. The D0 branes and membranes are dual to one another. Each can be found in the theory of the other. The two kinds of branes also have a kind of complementarity. As we have seen, the configurations of the matrix model which have classical interpretations in terms of D0 branes are those for which the Y ′ s commute. On the other hand the configurations of a membrane which have a classical interpretation are the extended membranes of large classical area. The area element is the Poisson bracket which in the matrix model is the commutator. Thus the very classical membranes are highly nonclassical configurations of D0 branes. In the paper of de Wit, Luscher, and Nicolai [6] a pathology of membrane theory was reported. It was found that the spectrum of the membrane Hamiltonian is continuous. The reason for this is the existence of the unlifted flat directions along which the commutators vanish. Previously it had been hoped that membranes would behave like strings and have discrete level structure and perhaps be the basis for a perturbation theory which would generalize string perturbation theory. In the present context this apparent pathology is exactly what we want. M-theory has no small coupling analogous to the string splitting amplitude. The bifurcation of membranes when the geometry degenerates is expected to be an order one process. The matrix model, if it is to describe all of M-theory must inextricably contain this process. In fact we have seen how important it is that supersymmetry maintains the flat directions. A model of a single noncommutative membrane actually contains an entire Fock space of particles in flat eleven dimensional space time. Another pathology of conventional membrane theories which we expect to be avoided in M-theory is the nonrenormalizability of the membrane world volume field theory. For finite N, it is clear that ultraviolet divergences on the world volume are absent because the noncommutative nature of the space defines a smallest volume cell, just like a Planck cell in quantum mechanical phase space (but we should emphasize here that this is a classical rather than quantum mechanical effect in the matrix model). The formal continuum limit which gives the membrane Hamiltonian is clearly valid for describing the classical motion of a certain set of metastable semiclassical states of the matrix model. It should not be expected to capture the quantum mechanics of the full large N limit. In particular it is clear that the asymptotic supergraviton states would look extremely singular and have no real meaning in a continuum membrane formalism. We are not claiming here to have a proof that the large N limit of the matrix quantum mechanics exists, but only that the issues involved in the existence of this limit are not connected to the renormalizability of the world volume field theory of the membrane. There is one last point worth making about membranes. It involves evidence for 11-D Lorentz invariance of the matrix model. We have considered in some detail the Galilean invariance of the infinite momentum frame and found that it is satisfied. But there is more to the Lorentz group. In particular there are generators J i which in the light cone formalism rotate the light like surface of initial conditions. The conditions for invarance under these transformations are the notorious angular conditions. We must also impose longitudinal boost invariance. The angular conditions are what makes Lorentz invariance so subtle in light cone string theory. It is clearly important to determine if the matrix model satisfies the angular conditions in the large N limit. In the full quantum theory the answer is not yet clear but at the level of the classical equations of motion the answer is yes. The relevant calculations were done by de Wit, Marquard and Nicolai [21]. The analysis is too complicated to repeat here but we can describe the main points. The equations for classical membranes can be given in covariant form in terms of a Nambu-Goto type action. In the covariant form the generators ot the full Lorentz group are straightforward to write down. In passing to the light cone frame the expressions for the nontrivial generators become more complicated but they are quite definite. In fact they can be expressed in terms of the Y (p, q) and their canonical conjugates Π(p, q). Finally, using the correspondence between functions of p, q and matrices we are led to matrix expressions for the generators. The expressions of course have factor ordering ambiguities but these, at least formally, vanish as N → ∞. In fact according to [21] the violation of the angular conditions goes to zero as 1/N2 . Needless to say a quantum version of this result would be very strong evidence for our conjecture. We cannot refrain from pointing out that the quantum version of the arguments of [21] is apt to be highly nontrivial. In particular, the classical argument works for every dimension in which the classical supermembrane exists, while, by analogy with perturbative string theory, we only expect the quantum Lorentz group to be recovered in eleven dimensions. Further, the longitudinal boost operator of [21] is rather trivial and operates only on a set of zero mode coordinates, which we have not included in our matrix model. Instead, we expect the longitudinal boost generator to involve rescaling N in the large N limit, and thus to relate the Hilbert spaces of different SUSY quantum mechanics models. We have already remarked in the previous section that, as anticipated in [7], longitudinal boost invariance is the key problem in our model. We expect it to be related to a generalization of the conformal invariance of perturbative string theory.9. Towards Derivation and Compactification In this section we would like to present a line of argument which may lead to a proof of the conjectured equivalence between the matrix model and M-theory. It relies on a stringy 23 extension of the conjectured nonrenormalization theorem combined with the possibility that all velocities in the large N cluster go to zero as N → ∞. Imagine that R stays fixed as N → ∞. Optimistically one might imagine that finite R errors are as small as in perturbative 11D supergravity, meaning that they are suppressed by powers of k11R or even exp(−k11R) where k11 is the center of mass longitudinal momentum transfer. So for k11 ∼ 1/lp we could imagine R fixed at a macroscopic scale and have very tiny errors. The mean field estimates discussed in section 7 give the velocity v ∼ N −1/9R, which, with R fixed, can be made arbitrarily small at large N. Although it is likely that the structure of the large N cluster is more complicated than the mean field description, it is possible that this general property of vanishing velocities at large N continues to hold. In particular, in Appendix A we present arguments that the velocities of the coordinates along some of the classical flat directions of the potential are small. We suspect that this can be generalized to all of the flat directions. If that is the case then the only high velocities, would be those associated with the “core ”wave function of Appendix A. The current argument assumes that the amplitude for the core piece of the wave function vanishes in the large N limit. Nonabelian field strength is the correct generalization of velocity for membrane type field configurations like those discussed in Section 8. For classical configurations at least these field strengths are order 1/N and so are also small. We have previously conjectured that the v 4 terms in the quantum mechanical effective action are not renormalized beyond one loop. For computing the eleven dimensional supergravity amplitude, we needed this result in the matrix quantum mechanics, but is possible that this result holds in the full string perturbation theory. For example, the excited open string states can be represented as additional non-BPS fields in the quantum mechanics. These do not contribute to the one loop v 4 term because they are not BPS. Perhaps they do not contribute to higher loops for related reasons. If these two properties hold then the conjecture follows. The scattering of large N clusters of D-0-branes can clearly be computed at small g (small R) using the quantum mechanics. But these processes, by assumption, only involve low velocities independent of g, and so only depend on the v 4 terms in the effective action which, by the stringy extension of the nonrenormalization theorem, would not receive g corrections. So the same quantum mechanical answers would be valid at large g (large R). This would prove the conjecture.From this point of view we have identified a subset of string theory processes (large N D-0-brane scattering) which are unchanged by stringy loop corrections and so are computable at strong coupling. If this line of argument is correct, it gives us an unambiguous prescription for compactification. We take the quantum mechanics which describes 0-brane motion at weak string coupling in the compactified space and then follow it to strong coupling. This approach to compactification requires us to add extra degrees of freedom in the compactified theory. We will discuss an alternative approach in the next section. For toroidal compactifications, it is clear at weak coupling that one needs to keep the strings which wrap any number of times around each circle. These unexcited wrapped string states are BPS so they do contribute to the v 4 term and hence must be kept. In fact these are the states which, in the annulus diagram, correct the power law in graviton scattering to its lower dimensional value, and are crucial in implementing the various T dualities. To be specific let us discuss the case of one coordinate X9 compactified on a circle on radius R9. Here we should keep the extra string winding states around X9 . An efficient way to keep track of them is to T dualize the X9 circle. This converts D-0- branes to D-1-branes and winding modes to momentum modes. The collection of N D-1-branes is described by a 1+1 dimensional SU(N) Super Yang Mills quantum field theory with coupling g s independent of R. For p-dimensional tori we get systems of D-p-branes described by p+1 dimensional SU(N) Super Yang Mills theory. Related issues have also recently been discussed in [22]. For more general compactifications the rule would be to keep every BPS state which contributes to the v 4 term at large N. We are currently investigating such compactifications, including ones with less supersymmetry. The line of argument presented in this section raises a number of questions. Is it permissible to hold R finite, or to let it grow very slowly with N? Are there nonperturbative corrections to the v 4 term? Large N probably prohibits instanton corrections in the quantum mechanics, but perhaps not in the full string theory. This might be related to the effect of various wrapped branes in compactified theories. Does the velocity stay low? A key problem here is that in the mean field theory cloud the 0-branes are moving very slowly. If two 0-branes encounter each other, their relative 25 velocity is much less than the typical velocity in a bound pair (v ∼ R). It seems that the capture cross section to go into the pair bound state should be very large. Why isn’t there clumping into pairs? One factor which might come into play is the following. If the velocity is very low the de Broglie wavelength of the particles might be comparable to the whole cluster (this is true in mean field), so their could be delicate phase correlations across the whole cluster–some kind of macroscopic quantum coherence. Whenever a pair is trying to form, another 0-brane might get between them and disrupt them. This extra coherent complexity might help explain the Lorentz invariance puzzle. 10. Another Approach to Compactification The conjecture which we have presented refers to an exact formulation of M-theory in uncompactified eleven dimensional spacetime. It is tempting to imagine that we can regain the compactified versions of the theory as particular collections of states in the large N limit of the matrix model. There is ample ground for suspicion that this may not be the case, and that degrees of freedom that we have thrown away in the uncompactified theory may be required for compactification. Indeed, in IMF field theory the only general method for discussing theories with moduli spaces of vacua is implementable only when the vacua are visible in the classical approximation. Then, we can shift the fields and do IMF quantization of the shifted theory. Different vacua correspond to different IMF Hamiltonians for the same degrees of freedom. The proposal of the previous section is somewhat in the spirit of IMF field theory. Different Hamiltonians, and indeed, different sets of degrees of freedom, are required to describe each compactified vacuum. We have begun a preliminary investigation of the alternative hypothesis, that different compactifications are already present in the model we have defined. This means that there must be collections of states which, in the large N limit, have S matrices which completely decouple from each other. Note that the large N limit is crucial to the possible existence of such superselection sectors. The finite N quantum mechanics cannot possibly have superselection rules. Thus, the only way in which we could describe compactifications for finite N would be to add degrees of freedom or change the Hamiltonian. We caution the reader that the approach we will describe below is very preliminary and highly conjectural. This approach to compactification is based on the idea that there is a sense in which our system defines a single “noncommuting membrane”. Consider compactification of a membrane on a circle. Then there are membrane configurations in which the embedding 26 coordinates do not transform as scalars under large diffeomorphisms of the membrane volume but rather are shifted by large diffeomorphisms of the target space. These are winding states. A possible approach to identifying the subset of states appropriate to a particular compactification, is to first find the winding states, and then find all states which have nontrivial scattering from them in the large N limit. In fact, our limited study below seems to indicate that all relevant states, including compactified supergravitons, can be thought of as matrix model analogs of membrane winding states. Let us consider compactification of the ninth transverse direction on a circle of radius 2πR9. A winding membrane is a configuration which satisfies where x 9 is an MXM matrix valued function of the angle variable. The other transverse bosonic coordinates, and all of the θs are MXM matrix valued functions of σ. These equations should be thought of as limits of finite matrices. Thus 2πR9P ≡ 2πR9 i ∂ ∂σ can be thought of as the limit of the finite matrices diag(−2πPR9 . . . 2πPR9), with σ the obvious tridiagonal matrix in this representation. The total longitudinal momentum of such a configuration is (2P +1)M R , and the ratio M/P is an effectively continuous parameter characterizing the states in the large N limit. We are not sure of the meaning of this parameter. To get a feeling for the physical meaning of this proposal, we examine the extreme limits of large and small R9. For large R9 it is convenient to work in the basis where P is diagonal. If we take all of the coordinates Xi independent of σ, then our winding membrane approaches a periodic array of (2P + 1) collections of D0 branes , each with longitudinal momentum M/R. We can find a solution of the BPS condition by putting 27 each collection into the M zero brane threshold bound state wave function. For large R9 configurations of the Xi which depend on σ have very high frequency, and can be integrated out. Thus, in this limit, the BPS state in this winding sector is approximately a periodic array of supergravitons. We identify this with the compactified supergraviton state. This state will have the right long range gravitational interactions (at scales larger than R9) in the eight uncompactified dimensions. To obtain the correct decompactified limit it would appear that we must rescale R, the radius of the longitudinal direction by R → (2P + 1)R as we take P and M to infinity. With this rescaling, all trace of the parameter M/P seems to disappear in the decompactification limit. For small R9, our analysis is much less complete. However, string duality suggests an approximation to the system in which we keep only configurations with M = 1 and P → ∞. In this case the σ dependence of X9 is pure gauge, and the Xi all commute with each other. The matrix model Hamiltonian becomes the Hamiltonian of the Green-Schwarz type IIA string: As in previous sections, we will construct multi wound membrane states by making large block diagonal matrices, each block of which is the previous single particle construction. Lest such structures appear overly baroque, we remind the reader that we are trying to make explicit constructions of the wave functions of a strongly interacting system with an infinite number of degrees of freedom. For large R9 it is fairly clear that the correct asymptotic properties of multiparticle states will be guaranteed by the BPS condition (assuming that everything works as conjectured in the uncompactified theory). If our ansatz is correct for small R9, it should be possible to justify the neglect of fluctuations of the matrix variables away from the special forms we have taken into account, as well as to show that the correct string interactions (for multistring configurations defined by the sort of block diagonal construction we have used above) are obtained from the matrix model interactions. In this connection it is useful to note that in taking the limit from finite matrices, there is no meaning to the separation of configurations into winding sectors which we have defined in the formal large N limit. In particular, X9 should be allowed to fluctuate. But we have seen that shifts of X9 by functions of σ are pure gauge, so that all fluctuations around the configurations which we have kept, give rise to higher derivative world sheet interactions. Since the P → ∞ limit is the world sheet continuum limit we should be able to argue that these terms are irrelevant operators in that limit. We have less 28 understanding about how the sum over world sheet topologies comes out of our formalism, but it is tempting to think that it is in some way connected with the usual topological expansion of large N matrix models. In the appendix we show that in eleven dimensions, dimensional analysis guarantees the dominance of planar graphs in certain calculations. Perhaps, in ten dimensions, the small dimensionless parameter R9 lp must be scaled with a power of N in order to obtain the limit of the matrix model which gives IIA string theory. These ideas can be extended to compactification on multidimensional tori. A wrapping configuration of a toroidal membrane can be characterized by describing the cycles on the target torus on which the a and b cycles of the membrane are mapped. This parametrization is redundant because of the SL(2, Z) modular invariance which exchanges the two membrane cycles. We propose that the analogs of these wrapping states, for a d-torus defined by modding out Rd by the shifts Xi → Xi + 2πRi a , is defined by the conditions where the x i are periodic MXM matrix valued functions of σ. The fermionic, and noncompact, coordinates are also matrix valued functions of σ. In order to discuss more complicated compactifications, we would have to introduce coordinates and find a group of large diffeomorphisms associated with one and two cycles around which membranes can wrap. Then we would search for embeddings of this group into the large N gauge group. Presumably, different coordinate systems would correspond to unitarily equivalent embeddings. We can even begin to get a glimpse of how ordinary Riemannian geometry would emerge from the matrix system. If we take a large manifold which breaks sufficient supersymmetries, the effective action for supergravitons propagating on such a manifold would be obtained, as before, by integrating over the off diagonal matrices. Now however, the nonrenormalization theorem would fail, and the kinetic term for the gravitons would contain a metric. The obvious conjecture is that this is the usual Riemannian metric on the manifold in question. If this is the case, our prescription for compactification in the noncommutative geometry of the matrix model, would reduce to ordinary geometry in the large radius limit. 29 A question which arises is whether the information about one and two cycles is sufficient to characterize different compactifications. We suspect that the answer to this is no. The moduli of the spaces that arise in string theoretic compactifications are all associated with the homology of the space, but in general higher dimensional cycles (e.g. three cycles in Calabi-Yau three folds) are necessary to a complete description of the moduli space. Perhaps in order to capture this information we will have to find the correct descriptions of five branes in the matrix model. If the theory really contains low energy SUGRA, then it will contain solitonic five branes, but it seems to us that the correct prescription is to define five branes as the D-branes of membrane theory. We do not yet understand how to introduce this concept in the matrix model. Finally, we would like to comment on the relation between the compactification schemes of this and the previous sections. For a single circle, if we take P to infinity, and substitute the formula (10.3) into the matrix model Hamiltonian (as well as the prescription that all other coordinates and supercoordinates are functions of σ), then we find the Hamiltonian of 1 + 1 dimensionally reduced 10D SYM theory in A0 = 0 gauge, with x 9 playing the role of the spatial component of the vector potential. Thus the prescription of the previous section appears to be a particular rule for how the large N limit should be taken in the winding configurations we have studied here. P is taken to infinity first, and then M is taken to infinity. The relation between the two approaches is reminiscent of the Eguchi-Kawai[23] reduction of large N gauge theory. It is clear once again that much of the physics of the matrix model is buried in the subtleties of the large N limit. For multidimensional tori, the relationship between the formalisms of this and the previous section is more obscure. 11. Conclusions Although the evidence we have given for the conjectured exact equivalence between the large N limit of supersymmetric matrix quantum mechanics and uncompactified 11 dimensional M-theory is not definitive, it is quite substantial. The evidence includes the following : 1. The matrix model has exact invariance under the Supergalilean group of the infinite momentum frame description of 11D Lorentz invariant theories. 2. Assuming the conventional duality between M-theory and IIA string theory, the matrix model has normalizable marginally bound states for any value of N. These states have 30 exactly the quantum numbers of the 11-D supergraviton multiplet. Thus the spectrum of single particle states is exactly that of M-theory. 3. As a consequence of supersymmetric nonrenormalization theorems, asymptotic states of any number of non-interacting supergravitons exist. These well separated particles propagate in a Lorentz invariant manner in 11 dimensions. They have the statistics properties of the SUGRA Fock space. 4. The matrix model exactly reproduces the correct long range interactions between supergravitons implied by 11-D supergravity, for zero longitudinal momentum exchange. This one loop result could easily be ruined by higher loop effects proportional to four powers of velocity. We believe that a highly nontrivial supersymmetry theorem protects us against all higher loop corrections of this kind. 5. By examining the pieces of the bound state wave function in which two clusters of particles are well separated from each other, a kind of mean field approximation, we find that the longest range part of the wave function grows with N exactly as required by the holographic principle. In particular the transverse density never exceeds one parton per Planck area. 6. The matrix model describes large classical membranes as required by M-theory. The membrane world volume is a noncommutative space with a fundamental unit of area analogous to the Planck area in phase space. These basic quanta of area are the original D0 branes from which the matrix model was derived. The tension of this matrix model membrane is precisely the same as that of the M-theory membrane. 7. At the classical level the matrix model realizes the full 11-D Lorentz invariance in the large N limit. Of course many unanswered questions remain. Locality is extremely puzzling in this system. Longitudinal boost invariance, as we have stressed earlier, is very mysterious. Resolving this issue, perhaps by understanding the intricate dynamics it seems to require, will be crucial in deciding whether or not this conjecture is correct. One way of understanding Lorentz invariance would be to search for a covariant version of the matrix model in which the idea of noncommutative geometry is extended to all of the membrane coordinates. An obvious idea is to consider functions of angular momentum operators and try to exploit the connection between spin networks and three dimensional diffeomorphisms. Alternatively one could systematically study quantum corrections to the angular conditions. 31 It is likely that more tests of the conjecture can be performed. In particular it should be possible to examine the large distance behavior of amplitudes with nonvanishing longitudinal momentum transfer and to compare them with supergravity perturbation theory. It will be important to to try to make precise the line of argument outlined in Section 9 that may lead to a proof of the conjecture. The approaches to compactification discussed in Sections 9 and 10 should be explored further. If the conjecture is correct, it would provide us with the first well defined nonperturbative formulation of a quantum theory which includes gravitation. In principle, with a sufficiently big and fast computer any scattering amplitude could be computed in the finite N matrix model with arbitrary precision. Numerical extrapolation to infinite N is in principle, if not in practice, possible. The situation is much like that in QCD where the only known definition of the theory is in terms of a conjectured limit of lattice gauge theory. Although the practical utility of the lattice theory may be questioned, it is almost certain that an extrapolation to the continuum limit exists. The existence of the lattice gauge Hamiltonian formulation insures that the the theory is unitary and gauge invariant. One can envision the matrix model formulation of M-theory playing a similar role. It would, among other things, insure that the rules of quantum mechanics are consistent with gravitation. Given that the classical long distance equations of 11-D supergravity have black hole solutions, a Hamiltonian formulation of M-theory would, at last, lay to rest the claim that black holes lead to a violation of quantum coherence. 		
31	Paper22	1939	On a Stationary System With Spherical Symmetry Consisting of Many Gravitating Masses	 ON A STATIONARY SYSTEM WITH SPHERICAL SYMMETRY  CONSISTING OF MANY GRAVITATING MASSES  BY ALBERT EINSTEIN  (Received May 10, 1939)  If one considers Schwarzschild's solution of the static gravitational field of  spherical symmetry   vanishes for r = A42. This means that a clock kept at this place would go at  the rate zero. Further it is easy to show that both light rays and material  particles take an infinitely long time (measured in "coordinate time") in order  to reach the point r = 4/2 when originating from a point r > A42. In this  sense the sphere r = 4/2 constitutes a place where the field is singular. (4 repre-  sents the gravitating mass.)  There arises the question whether it is possible to build up a field containing  such singularities with the help of actual gravitating masses, or whether such  regions with vanishing 944 do not exist in cases which have physical reality.  Schwarzschild himself investigated the gravitational field which is produced by  an incompressible liquid. He found that in this case, too, there appears a  region with vanishing g44 if only, with given density of the liquid, the radius of  the field-producing sphere is chosen large enough.  This argument, however, is not convincing; the concept of an incompressible  liquid is not compatible with relativity theory as elastic waves would have to  travel with infinite velocity. It would be necessary, therefore, to introduce a  compressible liquid whose equation of state excludes the possibility of sound  signals with a speed in excess of the velocity of light. But the treatment of any  such problem would be quite involved; besides, the choice of such an equation  of state would be arbitrary within wide limits, and one could not be sure that  thereby no assumptions have been made which contain physical impossibilities.  One is thus led to ask whether matter cannot be introduced in such a way  that questionable assumptions are excluded from the very beginning. In fact  this can be done by choosing, as the field-producing mass, a great number of   small gravitating particles which move freely under the influence of the field  produced by all of them together. This is a system resembling a spherical star  cluster. Hereby we may proceed as if the field, in which the particles are  moving, were produced by a continuous mass distribution of spherical sym-  metry, corresponding to the whole of the particles.  We can further simplify our considerations by the special assumption that  all particles move along circular paths around the center of symmetry of the  cluster. Even in this case it is still possible to choose arbitrarily the radial  distribution of mass density. The result of the following consideration will be  that it is impossible to make g44 zero anywhere, and that the total gravitating  mass which may be produced by distributing particles within a given radius,  always remains below a certain bound.  1. On the paths of the particles and their spacial distribution  By a suitable choice of the radial coordinate, it is possible to obtain the  gravitational field of the cluster of spherical symmetry in the form  (2) ds2 = -a(dx + dX + dx3) + b dt2,  whereby a and b are functions of r = (X2 + x2 + x2). First we shall investigate  the circular motion of one particle around the center of symmetry. Suppose,  for instance, this motion takes place within the plane x3 = 0. Through the  introduction of polar coordinates   It follows that in the case of a Schwarzschild field a particle is bound to follow  a path with a radius greater than (2 + \/3) times the radius of the Schwarzschild  singularity. This fact has the greatest significance for the following investiga-  tion: In the outermost layer of our particle cluster (and beyond it) the gravita-  tional field is given by (1). It follows that the total gravitating mass of the  cluster determines a lower limit for the radius of the cluster; this radius is (in  coordinate measure) more than (2 + \/3) times greater than the radius of the  Schwarzschild singularity as defined by the field in the empty space outside  the cluster.  The normal to the plane in which the particle considered moves has the  direction of X3. If it is assumed that the normals to an infinite number of such  planes are distributed at random and also that the phase angles of the paths are  subject to a random distribution, then we obtain a cluster of particles of spherical  symmetry whose paths have the radius r. The most general cluster to be  considered by us consists of an infinite number of clusters of this special type  which belong to all values of r. (More accurately speaking, the whole cluster  consists, of course, of a finite number of particles so that a field is created which  only approximates spherical symmetry.)   In order to formulate the conditions of dynamical equilibrium of the cluster  under the influence of its own gravitational field, we first have to compute the  energy tensor belonging to such a cluster. For this purpose we assume, for the  sake of simplicity that all particles have the same mass m.  2. The Matter-Energy Tensor of the Cluster  We consider the motion of particles within a volume element on the x3-axis.  The velocity vectors all have the same amount, they are perpendicular on the  x3-direction, and they are evenly distributed with respect to the directions  within the xI, x2 - plane. We know further that the matter-energy tensor  depends also on the particle density and on the gravitational potentials, but  not on the derivatives of the latter. It is, therefore, possible to determine this  tensor by a straightforward calculation.  First we consider particles, with the mass m and the particle density no per  unit volume, at rest with respect to a coordinate system of the theory of re-  stricted relativity. In such a case of the energy tensor only the (44)-com-  ponent exists,   We now proceed to the case that the components of the metric tensor are gii =  922 = 933 = -a and 944 = b. The components of the energy tensor are obtained  by applying the transformation law for tensors and by transforming the co-  ordinates according to   dl and dx4, contained in Tl and T44, are to be replaced dl by a'dl and dx4 by bld-t.  Further we have to introduce the particle density with respect to the new co-  ordinates, fl, according to   3. The Differential Equations of the Gravitational Field  The differential equation of a gravitational field which is due to a matter-  energy tensor are  (8) Go, = Rpv. - 4gtR + KIT#, = 0.  These equations have to be specialized for a static field of the type (2). By a  straight forward calculation the following equations are obtained for a point on  the xraxis:   For Ti, and T44 we have to substitute the expressions given by (7a), (7b). As m  is to be considered a given constant, the only functions of the coordinates in  these equations are n, a, and b. It is to be expected in the first place that n,  i.e. radial distribution of matter, remains undetermined by the equations.  This makes necessary the existence of an identity between the equations (9),  (10), (11). In fact such an identity exists. Its form is   It may be obtained in the following way: We have constructed T, by consider-  ing particles which satisfy the equations of motion in the field. Therefore the  covariant divergence of this tensor is bound to vanish identically. On the other  hand, the divergence of R,, - lg,,R vanishes identically on account of the  Bianchi identities. Of these four equations having the form of divergences only  the one with the index 3 yields anything which does not already vanish identi-  cally with respect to the G, , and that is (12). From the form of (12) it follows  that (10) is the consequence of (9) and (11). The problem is therefore reduced  to (9) and (11), and the particle density remains undetermined, as was to be  expected.  This result makes possible a further simplification of the problem. If, in (9),  the quantities a = ln (r2a) and $ = ln b are introduced, we obtain the equation   4. Localization of the Particles within a Thin Spherical Shell  Outside the cluster, the gravitational field is represented by Schwarzschild's  solution which, with our choice of the coordinate system, is given by (1). Inside  the cluster, the field is determined by (14). Thereby, the function n is to be  considered as given. However, n is not completely arbitrary, as the total radius  of the cluster is restricted by the lower limit given by (6a).  Equation (14) represents a complicated relation between the particle density  n and the function a representing the gravitational field. The limiting case,  however, in which the gravitating particles are concentrated within an infinitely  thin spherical shell, between r = ro- A and r = ro, is comparatively simple.  Of course, this case could only be realized if the individual particles had the  rest-volume zero, which cannot be the case. This idealization, however, still is  of interest as a limiting case for the radial distribution of the particles.  We divide the whole space into three zones for separate consideration, part 0  to be the part outside the shell, r _ ro, part I to be the part inside the shell,  r _ ro -A, and part S to be the part of the shell ro - A < r _ ro . In 0, the  gravitational field is represented by (1), in I, it is represented by (2) with  constant values of a and b. It follows that a' (and a') have to change within S  the faster the smaller A is chosen. However, as a' remains finite in S, a itself  changes only infinitely little in S. It is, therefore, permissible in S to neglect a'  compared with a". We therefore replace (14) within S by   It turns out that this is just the condition for the numerator of the expression  for zro to be real. (15), for each possible ro, gives the relationship between the  sum of the masses of the particles, mN, and the total gravitating mass g of the  cluster. For large values of ro , with a fixed value of g, one obtains in the limit  K  (16) 8K mN.  The factor K/8r is due to the fact that m is measured in grams, 4, however, in  gravitational units. (16) therefore simply states that in this limiting case the  gravitating mass of the cluster is equal to the sum of the particle masses.  The most illuminating way to express this result is the following:  Outside the shell (r > ro), the gravitational field is given by   This leads to a very interesting consequence: First it is clear that (2 - cr)/cr  may be replaced by (2 - c)/2 with good approximation and this by (M -,u)M.  This latter quantity is the relative decrease of energy of the cluster when it  contracts from an infinite radius to the radius ro. The table shows that this  contraction energy has a maximum near a- = 0.15, and for greater values of oa  i.e. smaller values of ro, it decreases again. The physical cause of this effect is  that, with decreasing ro, the potential energy of the cluster decreases, but the  kinetic energy increases. For sufficiently small values of ro the latter effect  surpasses the former.  It is therefore clear that the decrease of the radius with decreasing energy  would come to an end for a value of about a = 0.15, i.e. a radius of about  6.7(,u/2ro), while the lower limit of the radius as given by the velocity of light is  (2 + V/3) (ji/2ro). The value of r corresponding to the minimum energy means  an upper limit for the particle velocity in the direction of the tangent of about  0.65 times the light velocity.  5. Qualitative Discussion of the Case of Arbitrary Radial Mass Distribution  We consider the case of a given mass 1A and a shell radius ro satisfying the  inequality (6a). When a number N of particles is brought into this shell zone,   as determined by (15), then the exterior gravitational field is just completely  screened off from the interior I so that there the field will be Euclidean. This  means that the line element in I is characterized by constant values of a and b,  where b cannot reach its lower limit 1/A/3.  If, however, the number of particles in S is chosen smaller than according to  (15) then the field will not be screened off entirely (,u is hereby regarded as being  kept fixed). We can then satisfy the theory formally by replacing the Euclidean  line element in I by a Schwarzschild line element of the form   where A, B, and jil are constants. iii will be smaller than ji which characterizes  the field outside the shell. This interior field has a singularity of the Schwarz-  schild type (b = 0) at r = jil/2.  This singularity, however, can be removed by introducing a second shell Si  inside S, which has to be constructed so that the gravitational field in its interior  will be Euclidean. The whole cluster will then consist of two shells S and Si  and will have no Schwarzschild singularity.  Again this system can be modified by reducing the number of particles in Si  so that it will not screen off its exterior field (between S and SI) entirely; then a  third shell S2, of still smaller radius, may be constructed so that its exterior field  is just screened off entirely from its interior.  This method can be reiterated up to the center of the cluster. Thus one  obtains clusters with the most varied radial mass distributions. There will be  also various steady distributions. It is impossible, however, that b should  vanish anywhere. The radius of the cluster will always be greater than the  limiting radius '.s(2 + \/3), and it will not be possible to concentrate the matter  of the cluster arbitrarily densely near the center of the cluster.  6. The Case of Continuous Particle Density  The consideration given in part 5. leads toward the solution for continuous  distributions of the particle density. We divide the interval 0 < r < ro into an  infinite number of equal parts dr. We imagine that there is constructed in the  center of each partition dr a shell of a two dimensional character of the type  discussed in part 4. The shells may be chosen so that they are equivalent to a  continuous distribution of mass. Between any two subsequent shells we shall  have a gravitational field of the Schwarzschild type   gravitational field inside the cluster. Our task is to determine A, B, and r as  functions of r.  We consider two neighboring Schwarzschild solutions which belong to the  radius intervals r - 2 dr to r + 2 dr and r + 2 dr to r + 3dr. In the first region  the values of A, B, and r belong to the value r of the radius, in the second to the  value r + dr. If we use the quantities introduced by (2) then the two local  solutions are given by   where a, b are functions of r in accordance with (17). These two solutions are to  assume the same values for a and b in the point r + 2 dr because these quantities  must not change when we pass through a shell occupied by particles. It follows,  up to quantities of the first order   where a is written for r/2r.  These equations determine A, B as functions of r when r or a is given as func-  tion of r. It turns out that a, i3, computed from the solutions A, B of (18), are  the solutions of (13), represented with the help of the "parameter" function a.  r is arbitrary within certain limits because it is closely connected with the mass  distribution. On the other hand, A, B, and r have to satisfy the condition that  (17) makes possible circular particle paths for all values of r, i.e. a and b have to  satisfy the inequality (6). In connection with (17) we obtain the inequality   This inequality has to hold within as well as outside the cluster. For infinite  values of r, a vanishes. Further a has to be positive, as negative masses are  excluded. Because of the denominator, uf can nowhere be greater than 1.  Therefore the numerator of the left hand side has to be positive. As the second  factor of the numerator is always negative the first factor has to be negative, too.  We therefore obtain  (19b) o- < 2-\/3.  This is a generalization of (6a) as (6a) was only proven to hold for the outside  boundary of the cluster.  r represents the mass enclosed by the spherical surface of the radius r. In  order that negative masses should be ruled out it is necessary that everywhere  (20) dr > 0.  dr=  It is further necessary that r vanishes for r = 0. Save for this condition r  may be chosen arbitrarily if only u- satisfies (19b). When r and therefore u- is  given then the problem of determining the gravitational field of the form (17)  is reduced to the carrying out of two integrations, according to (18).  The equations (18) give us the integration of (13) with arbitrary mass density  distribution, where the latter is expressed by r or u. (14) gives the correspond-  ign particle density n. We shall express n in terms of u. We have   have r/2r where r is the gravitating mass contained in a sphere of the radius r.  r therefore increases monotonically with increasing r. If the mass density is  to be finite in the region around r = 0 then r has to decrease in that region at  least as fast as r3 and a at least as fast as r2. Under these conditions the two  first terms in (21) will be finite everywhere, and also A'IA, A, and a. (21)  therefore gives us a finite value for n. It is further possible to prove from the  properties of r that the sum of the two first terms in (21) is negative everywhere.  From all these considerations it can be followed that a and b are finite and not  zero in the whole space.  By combining (2), (4), (17), and (18) one can show that the ratio V between  the particle velocity and between the light velocity pointing into the same  direction, is given by 7. A Special Case of Continuous Mass Distribution  It is of some interest to investigate the case where u inside the cluster is a  constant 00. Strictly speaking this case falls outside of our conditions as a  ought to decrease toward the point r = 0 at least as fast as r2 in order that the  density in the neighborhood of the center should stay finite. We can satisfy  this condition by choosing u for instance  (24) 0_ = _o(1 - ecT2)  where c is to be an arbitrary constant. We then consider from the start the  limiting case of c = oc. This special case is discussed here in order to supple-  ment the discussions of part 4. There the whole mass was distributed as far  outside (within the total radius ro) as possible, while here we have a strong con-  centration of mass toward the center of the cluster.  As r is the gravitating mass enclosed by a spherical surface of the radius r,  dr/(47rr2dr) is the mean density of the gravitating mass in the point r. As  2. r = 2uo-r we obtain for this mean density mo/27rr , i.e. a radial decrease of the den-  sity like 1/r2 up to the cluster boundary r = ro .  From (18), in accordance with (24) (in the limiting case of vanishing expo  nential term), we obtain For r = 0 we obtain a = oo and b = 0. This type of singularity, however, is  not to be taken seriously because it would be avoided if we had taken into con-  sideration the exponential term in (24). It is to be noted that through a suitable  choice of the mass distribution this singularity can be approximated, but not  reached.  We make use of (21) in order to determine the relation existing between the  sum of the rest masses of the particles M  M= Kml nm47rfr2dr,  and the total gravitating mass of the cluster 4u. It can be shown that the first  term of (21) gives only a vanishing contribution for infinitely great values of c.  This follows from the fact that 1+ ) vanishes everywhere where the influence  of the exponential term of (24) has become unnoticeable. We compute the  contribution of the second term in (21) by omitting the exponential term from  the start and obtain, after a short calculation, as the final result, with y = 2rooo  (25) M = ,A(1-4co- + 1+U ( l O 2.  This equation when compared with the relation  (26) j = 2ioro  allows an easy discussion of the essential properties of clusters of this type.  First it is easy to see that we have extremely simple relations when we change  M but keep fixed uo (O < uo < 2 - \/3) and thereby the tangential velocity of  the particles as measured in light velocity units. When M is multiplied by z  the gravitating mass will be zu and the diameter of the cluster will be z* 2r.  The mean density will be multiplied by 1/z2.  In order to obtain a survey of all possibilities it is therefore sufficient to keep  fixed the number of constituting particles and thereby M and to vary so together  with the diameter 2ro and the gravitating mass A. We obtain for When the cluster is contracted from an infinite diameter its mass decreases at  the most about 5%. This minimal mass will be reached when the diameter 2ro  is about 9. The diameter can be further reduced down to about 5.6, but only by  adding enormous amounts of energy. It is not possible to compress the cluster  any more while preserving the chosen mass distribution. A further addition  of energy enlarges the diameter again. In this way the energy content, i.e. the  gravitating mass of the cluster, can be increased arbitrarily without destroying  the cluster. To each possible diameter there belong two clusters (when the  number of particles is given) which differ with respect to the particle velocity.  Of course, these paradoxical results are not represented by anything in physi-  cal nature. Only that branch belonging to smaller co values contains the cases  bearing some resemblance to real stars, and this branch only for diameter values  between cc and 9M.  The case of the cluster of the shell type, discussed earlier in this paper, behaves  quite similarly to this one, despite the different mass distribution. The shell  type cluster, however, does not contain a case with infinite 1,u given a finite M.  The essential result of this investigation is a clear understanding as to why the  "Schwarzschild singularities" do not exist in physical reality. Although the  theory given here treats only clusters whose particles move along circular paths  it does not seem to be subject to reasonable doubt that mote general cases will  have analogous results. The "Schwarzschild singularity" does not appear for  the reason that matter cannot be concentrated arbitrarily. And this is due to  the fact that otherwise the constituting particles would reach the velocity of  light.  This investigation arose out of discussions the author conducted with Professor  H. P. Robertson and with Drs. V. Bargmann and P. Bergmann on the mathe-  matical and physical significance of the Schwarzschild singularity. The problem  quite naturally leads to the question, answered by this paper in the negative,  as to whether physical models are capable of exhibiting such a singularity.		 Albert Einstein

VOLKOFF Department of Physics, University of California, Berkeley, California (Received January 3, 1939) It has been suggested that, when the pressure within stellar matter becomes high enough, a new phase consisting of neutrons will be formed. In this paper we study the gravitational equilibrium of masses of neutrons, using the equation of state for a cold Fermi gas, and general relativity. For masses under —,Q only one equilibrium solution exists, which is approximately described by the nonrelativistic Fermi equation of state and Newtonian gravitational theory. For masses —, 'Q &m&-,'Q two solutions exist, one stable and quasi-Newtonian, one more condensed, and unstable. For masses greater than 4 Q there are no static equilibrium solutions. These results are qualitatively confirmed by comparison with suitably chosen special cases of the analytic solutions recently discovered by Tolman. A discussion of the probable eEect of deviations from the Fermi equation of state suggests that actual stellar matter after the exhaustion of thermonuclear sources of energy will, if massive enough, contract indefinitely, although more and more slowly, never reaching true equilibrium.  I. INTRoDUcTIQN ~OR the application of the methods commonly used in attacking the problem of stellar structure' the distribution of energy sources and their dependence on the physical conditions within the star must be known. Since at the time of Eddington's original studies not much was known about the physical processes responsible for the generation of energy within a star, various mathematically convenient assumptions were made in regard to the energy sources, and these led to different star models (e.g. the Eddington model, the point source model, etc.). It was found that with a given equation of state for the stellar material many important properties of the solutions (such as the mass-luminosity law) were quite insensitive to the choice of assumptions about the distribution of energy sources, but were common to a wide range of models. In 1932 Landau' proposed that instead of making arbitrary assumptions about energy sources chosen merely for mathematical convenience, one should attack the problem by first investigating the physical nature of the equilibrium of a given mass of material in which no energy is generated, and from which there is no radiation, presumably in the hope that such an ~A. Eddington, The Internal Constitution of the Stars (Cambridge University Press, 1926); B. Stromgren, Ergebn. Exakt. Naturwiss. 10, 465 (1937);Short summary in G. Gamow, Phys. Rev. 53, 595 (1938). ' L. Landau, Physik. Zeits. Sowjetunion 1, 285 (1932). 3 investigation would afford some insight into the more general situation where the generation of energy is taken into account. Although such a model gives a good description of a white dwarf star in which most of the material is supposed to be in a degenerate state with a zero point energy high compared to thermal energies of even 10' degrees, and such that the pressure is determined essentially by the density only and not by the temperature, still it would fail completely to describe a normal main sequence star, in which on the basis of the Eddington model the stellar material is nondegenerate, and the existence of energy sources and of the consequent temperature and pressure gradients plays an important part in determining the equilibrium conditions. The stability of a model in which the energy sources have to be taken into account is known to depend also on the temperature sensitivity of the energy sources and on the presence or absence of a time-lag in their response to temperature changes. However, if the view which seems plausible at present is adopted that the principal sources of stellar energy, at least in main sequence stars, are thermonuclear reactions, then the limiting case considered by Landau again becomes of interest in the discussion of what will eventually happen to a normal main sequence star after all the elements available for thermonuclear reactions are used up. Landau showed that for a model consisting of a cold degenerate Fermi gas there exist no stable equilibrium configurations for masses greater than a certain critical mass, all larger masses tending to collapse. For a mixture of electrons and nuclei in which on the average there are two protonic masses per electron Landau found the critical mass to be roughly 1.5 Q, and in general the critical mass is inversely proportional to the square of the mass per particle obtained by spreading out the total mass over only those particles which essentially determine the pressure of the Fermi gas. The possibility has been suggested' that in sufficiently massive stars after all the thermonuclear sources of energy, at least for the central material of the star, have been exhausted a condensed neutron core would be formed. The minimum mass for which such a core would be stable has been estimated by Oppenheimer and Serber, ' who on taking into account some effects of nuclear forces give approximately 0.1Q as a reasonable minimum mass. The gradual growth of such a core with the accompanying liberation of gravitational energy is suggested by Landau as a possible source of stellar energy. In this connection it seems of interest to ask whether this model of the final state of a star can be right for arbitrarily heavy stars, i.e., to investigate whether there is an upper limit to the possible size of such a neutron core. Landau's original result for a cold relativistically degenerate Fermi gas quoted above gives in the case of a neutron gas an upper limit of about 6Q beyond which the core would not be stable but would tend to collapse. Two objections might be raised against this result. One is that it was obtained on the basis of Newtonian gravitational theory while for such high masses and densities general relativistic effects must be considered. The other one is that the Fermi gas was assumed to be relativistically degenerate throughout the whole core, while it might be expected that on the one hand, because of the large mass of the neutron, the nonrelativistically degenerate equation of state might be more appropriate over the greater part of the core, and on the other hand the gravitational effect of the kinetic energy of the neutrons could not be neglected. The present investigation seeks to establish what differences are introduced into the result if general relativistic gravitational theory is used instead of Newtonian, and if a more exact equation of state is used. A discussion of the general relativistic treatment of the equilibrium of spherically symmetric distributions of matter is first given, and then the special ideal case of a cold neutron gas is treated. A discussion of the results, and comparison with some results of Professor R. C. Tolman reported in an accompanying paper are given in the concluding sections. II. RELATIVISTIC TREATMENT OF EQUILIBRIUM It is known' that the most general static line element exhibiting spherical symmetry may be expressed in the form where p and p are respectively the pressure and the macroscopic energy density measured in proper coordinates. With these expressions for the line element and for the energy momentum tensor, and with the cosmological constant A taken equal to zero, Einstein's field equations reduce to:~termine the mechanical equilibrium of the matter distribution as well as the dependence of the g»'s on r. The boundary of the matter distribution is the value of r =rb for which P =0, and such that for r (rb, p )0. For r (rb the solution depends on the equation of state of the material connecting p and p. For many equations of state a sharp boundary exists with a finite value of rb. In empty space surrounding the spherically symmetric distribution of matter p  Schwarzschild's exterior solution is obtained:  Thus e" is known as a function of r if p is known as a function of r Further in. Eq. (4) introduce a new variable  by its value from (8) and v' by its value from (5). It becomes:  ' R. C. Tolman, reference 5, p. 203. ' R. C. Tolman, reference 5, pp. 203 and 207. The constants A and 8 are fixed by the requirement that at great distances away from the .matter distribution the g„„'s must go over into their weak-field form, i.e., 8= 1,A = —2m where m is the total Newtonian mass of the matter as calculated by a distant observer. ' Inside the boundary Eqs. (3), (4) and (5) may be rewritten as follows. Using the equation of state p =p(p) Eq. (5) may be immediately integrated.Equations (9) and (10) form a system of two first-order equations in I and p. Starting with some initial values u=u&& p= p&& at r=0, the two equations are integrated simultaneously to the value r=rb where P=O, i.e., until the boundary of the matter distribution is reached. The value of u=u~ at r =r~ determines the value of e"("b) at the boundary, and this is joined continuously across the boundary to the exterior solution, makingThus the mass of this spherical distribution of matter as measured by a distant observer is given by the value I& of I at r=rb. The following restrictions must be made on the choice of p&& and u&&, the initial values of p and u at r=O: (a) In accordance with its physical meaning as pressure, P&&~0. (b) From Eq.

However, it may be shown that of all the finite values of p&& at the origin p&& ——0 is the only one compatible with a negative value of No, and that for equations of state of the type occurring in this problem even this possibility is excluded, so that No must vanish.

PARTIcULAR EQUATIoNs QF STATE The above arguments show that Eqs. (9) and (10) together with a given equation of state completely determine the distribution of matter. These equations are to be integrated from the values N=O, t=tp at r=O to r=r~ where tg=O (which makes p=0), and u=uq. A note must be made of the units employed in these equations. Eqs. (3), (4) and (3) from which (16) and (17) are derived are stated in relativistic units, " i.e., such that c=1, G=1 (c is the velocity of light, G is the gravitational constant). This determines the unit of time and the unit of mass in terms of a still arbitrary unit of length. The unit of length is now fixed by the requirement that Z=1/4m. Eqs. (16) and (17) now become: - (20) dr -r3—e'+n . r(r —2u) 6 (21) '4 R. C. Tolman, reference 5, pp. 201—202. For a neutron gas a=1.36X10'cm, b=1.83)&10" g. The general character of the solution is seen to be independent of the mass of the neutron which determines only the scale of the result. No way was found to carry out the integration analytically, so Eqs. (18) and (19) were integrated numerically for several finite values of $p. For all these cases up was taken to be equal to zero, since the equation of state near the origin for finite to behaves like p(p) =Zp*, s(1.

Since p is a monotonic function of t, the curves of free energy against t& for fixed total number of particles, and thus for a fixed Mo (gravitational mass at zero density; the gravitational mass will vary somewhat along a curve of constant particle number, as the density increases), will for small masses have the same general character as the curves of free energy against some average density in the nonrelativistic case (cf. the curve for y=5/3 in Fig. 2). Then as the number of particles is increased the character of the free energy curves must change in order to admit the possibility of a second equilibrium position. Since the free energy must be a continuous function of to, and since we know from nonrelativistic calculations that for small masses (and low densities) we have a position of stable equilibrium (a minimum in the free energy curve) we can conclude that the second equilibrium position corresponds either to a maximum or to an inHection point in the free energy curve (and certainly not to a minimum). Fig. 3 gives a schematic plot of free energy against to for different values of Mo which would explain the existence of one equilibrium position for small masses, two for intermediate masses, and none for large masses. The masses marked on the curves are the actual gravitational masses corresponding to the equilibrium points of the critical free energy curves separating the solutions into the three types mentioned above. IV. DIscUssIQN —RELATIQN To TQLMAN s SQLUTIoNs Before we study the physical implications of these results, we may try to show how their qualitative features may be obtained from the analytic solutions recently discovered by Professor Tolman. '~ This will also help us to understand the probable effect of alterations in the equation of state of the neutron gas at high densities. On the one hand Tolman's solution IV, discussed in f6 of his paper, enables us to understand the existence of a limiting mass for static solutions and to give an estimate of its magnitude; on the other hand Tolman's solution VI, discussed in )8 (and less directly solution V), has for n =-'„very much the character of our singular solution for to—+ , and, with appropriately chosen constants, gives a mass of the same order of magnitude as we have found. Tolman's solution IV is nonsingular, and corresponds to the quadratic equation of state (6.5) of his paper:If p. and p, are now themselves connected by the Fermi equation of state (11), {12),then P, ~ p,'I' as pg~0, Rnd pc 3pg~0(pg ) Rs pg~ +&, Rnd II$1s seen to have a maximum value.

It should be observed that for the critical solution with m 0.7'Q the potentials g„, are nowhere singular, and that in particular such a core does not tend to "protect itself" from the addition of further matter by the vanishing of g44 at the boundary. THere would then seem to be only two answers possible to the question of the "6nal" behavior of very massive stars: either the equation ofstate we have used so far fails to describe the behavior of highly condensed matter that the conclusions reached above are qualitatively misleading, or the star will continue to contract indefinitely, never reaching equilibrium. Both alternatives require serious consideration. The central density in the "critical" core is even higher than nuclear density, so that our extrapolation of the Fermi equation of state can hardly rest on a very sure basis. Under these conditions the disintegration of neutrons, either into protons and electrons, or into mesotrons, will be energetically unfavorable and will not occur. And the relatively weak attractive forces which are known to act between neutrons will facilitate, and not prevent, the collapse of the core. If, however, under extreme compression, phenomena occurred which have the eRect of repulsive forces, i.e., of raising the pressure for a given density above the value given by the Fermi equation of state, this could tend to prevent the collapse. Such repulsive forces, even if they exist, will hardly make possible static solutions for arbitrarily large amounts of matter. For at low densities they cannot appreciably affect the equation of state, so that the dimensions of the core will necessarily be finite, and so will be the gravitational mass m of the core m=-,'rq(1 —e "') (Tolman, 5.5). Nor can the mass 350 before collapse be infinite. For this to be true we should have to have a singular solution. But the effect of repulsive forces can for high density at most be to make 3P even more nearly equal to p than for the Fermi equation of state; and for p=3P, as has been remarked above, and as is also suggested by Tolman's solutions V and VI, the only singular static solution is (22), for which the total particle number is finite. We may obtain an extreme limit on the increase in the limiting mass which strong repulsive forces at high densities could give, by the following simple argument. For p(10" g/cm' these forces can hardly be important. Let us assume that for p&~ j.0", they have the extremeeffect of making p=-,'p. Then the mass of a sphere for which this equation of state holds down to p = 10", and for which p falls rapidly as p—+0, is given by our solution (22), and is of the order of Q. It seems likely that our limit of 0.7S is near the truth. This argument is based on the requirement that even for arbitrarily high densities, p—3p shall not be negative; and this is in turn closely related to the positive definite character of the (proper) energy density of neutrons and of the 6elds of force (apart from gravitation) associated with them. It seems probable that if P could be very much greater than -,'p, static solutions of arbitrarily large mass could be found. " From this discussion it appears probable that for an understanding of the long time behavior of actual heavy stars a consideration of nonstatic solutions must be essential. Among all (spherical) nonsta, tic solutions one would hope to find some for which the rate of contraction, and in general the time variation, become slower and slower, so that these solutions might be regarded, not as equilibrium solutions, but as quasi-static. Some reason for this we may see in the following argument: for large enough mass the core will collapse; near the center the density and pressure will grow, and g44=e" will be small (cf.Eq. (7)); and as e" grows smaller, all processes will, as seen by an outside observer, slow down in the central region. Formally one sees this, in the occurrence, in Einstein's equations, of products of the formFor high enough central densities it is no longer . justified to neglect even a very slow time variation; and the singular solutions which presumably represent very massive neutron cores cannot be obtained unless this is taken into account. These solutions are now being investigated.	It has been suggested that, when the pressure within stellar matter becomes high enough, a new phase consisting of neutrons will be formed. In this paper we study the gravitational equilibrium of masses of neutrons, using the equation of state for a cold Fermi gas, and general relativity. For masses under —,Q only one equilibrium solution exists, which is approximately described by the nonrelativistic Fermi equation of state and Newtonian gravitational theory. For masses —, 'Q &m&-,'Q two solutions exist, one stable and quasi-Newtonian, one more condensed, and unstable. For masses greater than 4 Q there are no static equilibrium solutions. These results are qualitatively confirmed by comparison with suitably chosen special cases of the analytic solutions recently discovered by Tolman. A discussion of the probable eEect of deviations from the Fermi equation of state suggests that actual stellar matter after the exhaustion of thermonuclear sources of energy will, if massive enough, contract indefinitely, although more and more slowly, never reaching true equilibrium.

I. The Shadow of the Supermassive Black Hole The Event Horizon Telescope Collaboration (See the end matter for the full list of authors.) Received 2019 March 1; revised 2019 March 12; accepted 2019 March 12; published 2019 April 10 Abstract When surrounded by a transparent emission region, black holes are expected to reveal a dark shadow caused by gravitational light bending and photon capture at the event horizon. To image and study this phenomenon, we have assembled the Event Horizon Telescope, a global very long baseline interferometry array observing at a wavelength of 1.3 mm. This allows us to reconstruct event-horizon-scale images of the supermassive black hole candidate in the center of the giant elliptical galaxy M87. We have resolved the central compact radio source as an asymmetric bright emission ring with a diameter of 42 ± 3 μas, which is circular and encompasses a central depression in brightness with a flux ratio 10:1. The emission ring is recovered using different calibration and imaging schemes, with its diameter and width remaining stable over four different observations carried out in different days. Overall, the observed image is consistent with expectations for the shadow of a Kerr black hole as predicted by general relativity. The asymmetry in brightness in the ring can be explained in terms of relativistic beaming of the emission from a plasma rotating close to the speed of light around a black hole. We compare our images to an extensive library of ray-traced general-relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations of black holes and derive a central mass of M = (6.5 ± 0.7) × 109 Me. Our radiowave observations thus provide powerful evidence for the presence of supermassive black holes in centers of galaxies and as the central engines of active galactic nuclei. They also present a new tool to explore gravity in its most extreme limit and on a mass scale that was so far not accessible. Key words: accretion, accretion disks – black hole physics – galaxies: active – galaxies: individual (M87) – galaxies: jets – gravitation 1. Introduction Black holes are a fundamental prediction of the theory of general relativity (GR; Einstein 1915). A defining feature of black holes is their event horizon, a one-way causal boundary in spacetime from which not even light can escape (Schwarzschild 1916). The production of black holes is generic in GR (Penrose 1965), and more than a century after Schwarzschild, they remain at the heart of fundamental questions in unifying GR with quantum physics (Hawking 1976; Giddings 2017). Black holes are common in astrophysics and are found over a wide range of masses. Evidence for stellar-mass black holes comes from X-ray (Webster & Murdin 1972; Remillard & McClintock 2006) and gravitational-wave measurements (Abbott et al. 2016). Supermassive black holes, with masses from millions to tens of billions of solar masses, are thought to exist in the centers of nearly all galaxies (Lynden-Bell 1969; Kormendy & Richstone 1995; Miyoshi et al. 1995), including in the Galactic center (Eckart & Genzel 1997; Ghez et al. 1998; Gravity Collaboration et al. 2018a) and in the nucleus of the nearby elliptical galaxy M87 (Gebhardt et al. 2011; Walsh et al. 2013). Active galactic nuclei (AGNs) are central bright regions that can outshine the entire stellar population of their host galaxy. Some of these objects, quasars, are the most luminous steady sources in the universe (Schmidt 1963; Sanders et al. 1989) and are thought to be powered by supermassive black holes accreting matter at very high rates through a geometrically thin, optically thick accretion disk (Shakura & Sunyaev 1973; Sun & Malkan 1989). In contrast, most AGNs in the local universe, including the Galactic center and M87, are associated with supermassive black holes fed by hot, tenuous accretion flows with much lower accretion rates (Ichimaru 1977; Narayan & Yi 1995; Blandford & Begelman 1999; Yuan & Narayan 2014). In many AGNs, collimated relativistic plasma jets (Bridle & Perley 1984; Zensus 1997) launched by the central black hole contribute to the observed emission. These jets may be powered either by magnetic fields threading the event horizon, extracting the rotational energy from the black hole (Blandford & Znajek 1977), or from the accretion flow (Blandford & Payne 1982). The near-horizon emission from low-luminosity active galactic nuclei (LLAGNs; Ho 1999) is produced by synchrotron radiation that peaks from the radio through the farinfrared. This emission may be produced either in the accretion flow (Narayan et al. 1995), the jet (Falcke et al. 1993), or both (Yuan et al. 2002). When viewed from infinity, a nonrotating Schwarzschild (1916) black hole has a photon capture radius Rc g = 27 r , where rg GM c º 2 is the characteristic lengthscale of a black hole. The photon capture radius is larger than the Schwarzschild radius RS that marks the event horizon of a nonrotating black hole, RS ≡ 2 rg. Photons approaching the black hole with an impact parameter b < Rc are captured and plunge into the black hole (Hilbert 1917); photons with b > Rc escape to infinity; photons with b = Rc are captured on an unstable circular orbit and produce what is commonly referred to as the lensed “photon ring.” In the Kerr (1963) metric, which describes black holes with spin angular momentum, Rc changes with the ray’s orientation relative to the angular-momentum vector, and the black hole’s cross section is not necessarily circular(Bardeen 1973). This change is small (4%), but potentially detectable (Takahashi 2004; Johannsen & Psaltis 2010). The simulations of Luminet (1979) showed that for a black hole embedded in a geometrically thin, optically thick accretion disk, the photon capture radius would appear to a distant observer as a thin emission ring inside a lensed image of the accretion disk. For accreting black holes embedded in a geometrically thick, optically thin emission region, as in LLAGNs, the combination of an event horizon and light bending leads to the appearance of a dark “shadow” together with a bright emission ring that should be detectable through very long baseline interferometery (VLBI) experiments (Falcke et al. 2000a). Its shape can appear as a “crescent” because of fast rotation and relativistic beaming (Falcke et al. 2000b; Bromley et al. 2001; Noble et al. 2007; Broderick & Loeb 2009; Kamruddin & Dexter 2013; Lu et al. 2014). The observed projected diameter of the emission ring, which contains radiation primarily from the gravitationally lensed photon ring, is proportional to Rc and hence to the mass of the black hole, but also depends nontrivially on a number of factors: the observing resolution, the spin vector of the black hole and its inclination, as well as the size and structure of the emitting region. These factors are typically of order unity and can be calibrated using theoretical models. Modern general-relativistic simulations of accretion flows and radiative transfer produce realistic images of black hole shadows and crescents for a wide range of near-horizon emission models (Broderick & Loeb 2006; Mościbrodzka et al. 2009; Dexter et al. 2012; Dibi et al. 2012; Chan et al. 2015; Mościbrodzka et al. 2016; Porth et al. 2017; Chael et al. 2018a; Ryan et al. 2018; Davelaar et al. 2019). These images can be used to test basic properties of black holes as predicted in GR (Johannsen & Psaltis 2010; Broderick et al. 2014; Psaltis et al. 2015), or in alternative theories of gravity (Grenzebach et al. 2014; Younsi et al. 2016; Mizuno et al. 2018). They can also be used to test alternatives to black holes (Bambi & Freese 2009; Vincent et al. 2016; Olivares et al. 2019). VLBI at an observing wavelength of 1.3 mm (230 GHz) with Earth-diameter-scale baselines is required to resolve the shadows of the core of M87 (M87* hereafter) and of the Galactic center of Sagittarius A* (Sgr A* , Balick & Brown 1974), the two supermassive black holes with the largest apparent angular sizes (Johannsen et al. 2012). At 1.3 mm and shorter wavelengths, Earthdiameter VLBI baselines achieve an angular resolution sufficient to resolve the shadow of both sources, while the spectra of both sources become optically thin, thus revealing the structure of the innermost emission region. Early pathfinder experiments (Padin et al. 1990; Krichbaum et al. 1998) demonstrated the feasibility of VLBI techniques at ∼1.3 mm wavelengths. Over the following decade, a program to improve sensitivity of 1.3 mm-VLBI through development of broadband instrumentation led to the detection of event-horizon-scale structures in both Sgr A* and M87* (Doeleman et al. 2008, 2012). Building on these observations, the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) collaboration was established to assemble a global VLBI array operating at a wavelength of 1.3 mm with the required angular resolution, sensitivity, and baseline coverage to image the shadows in M87* and Sgr A* . In this paper, we present and discuss the first event-horizonscale images of the supermassive black hole candidate M87* from an EHT VLBI campaign conducted in 2017 April at a wavelength of 1.3 mm. The accompanying papers give a more extensive description of the instrument (EHT Collaboration et al. 2019a, Paper II), data reduction (EHT Collaoration et al. 2019b, hereafter Paper III), imaging of the M87 shadow (EHT Collaboration et al. 2019c, hereafter Paper IV), theoretical models (EHT Collaboration et al. 2019d, hereafter Paper V), and the black hole mass estimate (EHT Collaboration et al. 2019e, hereafter Paper VI). 2. The Radio Core in M87 In Curtis (1918), Heber Curtis detected a linear feature in M87, later called a “jet” by Baade & Minkowski (1954). The jet is seen as a bright radio source, Virgo A or 3C 274 (Bolton et al. 1949; Kassim et al. 1993; Owen et al. 2000), which extends out to 65 kpc with an age estimated at about 40 Myr and a kinetic power of about 1042 to 1045 erg s−1 (de Gasperin et al. 2012; Broderick et al. 2015). It is also well studied in the optical (Biretta et al. 1999; Perlman et al. 2011), X-ray (Marshall et al. 2002), and gamma-ray bands (Abramowski et al. 2012). The upstream end of the jet is marked by a compact radio source (Cohen et al. 1969). Such compact radio sources are ubiquitous in LLAGNs (Wrobel & Heeschen 1984; Nagar et al. 2005) and are believed to be signatures of supermassive black holes. The radio structures of the large-scale jet (Owen et al. 1989; de Gasperin et al. 2012) and of the core of M87 (Reid et al. 1989; Junor et al. 1999; Hada et al. 2016; Mertens et al. 2016; Kim et al. 2018b; Walker et al. 2018) have been resolved in great detail and at multiple wavelengths. Furthermore, the leveling-off of the “core-shift” effect (Blandford & Königl 1979), where the apparent position of the radio core shifts in the upstream jet direction with decreasing wavelength from increased transparency to synchrotron self-absorption, indicates that at a wavelength of 1.3 mm M87* is coincident with the supermassive black hole (Hada et al. 2011). The envelope of the jet limb maintains a quasi-parabolic shape over a wide range of distances from ∼105 rg down to ∼20 rg (Asada & Nakamura 2012; Hada et al. 2013; Nakamura & Asada 2013; Nakamura et al. 2018; Walker et al. 2018). VLBI observations at 1.3 mm have revealed a diameter of the emission region of ∼40 μas, which is comparable to the expected horizon-scale structure (Doeleman et al. 2012; Akiyama et al. 2015). These observations, however, were not able to image the black hole shadow due to limited baseline coverage. Based on three recent stellar population measurements, we here adopt a distance to M87 of 16.8 ± 0.8 Mpc (Blakeslee et al. 2009; Bird et al. 2010; Cantiello et al. 2018, see Paper VI). Using this distance and the modeling of surface brightness and stellar velocity dispersion at optical wavelengths (Gebhardt & Thomas 2009; Gebhardt et al. 2011), we infer the mass of M87* to be M 6.2 10 0.6 = ´ 1.1 9 - + Me (see Table 9 in Paper VI). On the other hand, mass measurements modeling the kinematic structure of the gas disk (Harms et al. 1994; Macchetto et al. 1997) yield M 3.5 10 0.3 = ´ 0.9 9 - + Me (Walsh et al. 2013, Paper VI). These two mass estimates, from stellar and gas dynamics, predict a theoretical shadow diameter for a Schwarzschild black hole of 37.6 as 3.5 6.2 - m + and 21.3 as 1.7 5 - m + , respectively. 3. The Event Horizon Telescope The EHT (Paper II) is a VLBI experiment that directly measures “visibilities,” or Fourier components, of the radio brightness distribution on the sky. As the Earth rotates, each telescope pair in the network samples many spatial frequencies.The array has a nominal angular resolution of λ/L, where λ is the observing wavelength and L is the maximum projected baseline length between telescopes in the array (Thompson et al. 2017). In this way, VLBI creates a virtual telescope that spans nearly the full diameter of the Earth. To measure interferometric visibilities, the widely separated telescopes simultaneously sample and coherently record the radiation field from the source. Synchronization using the Global Positioning System typically achieves temporal alignment of these recordings within tens of nanoseconds. Each station is equipped with a hydrogen maser frequency standard. With the atmospheric conditions during our observations the coherent integration time was typically 10 s (see Figure 2 in Paper II). Use of hydrogen maser frequency standards at all EHT sites ensures coherence across the array over this timescale. After observations, recordings are staged at a central location, aligned in time, and signals from each telescope-pair are cross-correlated. While VLBI is well established at centimeter and millimeter wavelengths (Boccardi et al. 2017; Thompson et al. 2017) and can be used to study the immediate environments of black holes (Krichbaum et al. 1993; Doeleman et al. 2001), the extension of VLBI to a wavelength of 1.3 mm has required long-term technical developments. Challenges at shorter wavelengths include increased noise in radio receiver electronics, higher atmospheric opacity, increased phase fluctuations caused by atmospheric turbulence, and decreased efficiency and size of radio telescopes in the millimeter and submillimeter observing bands. Started in 2009 (Doeleman et al. 2009a), the EHT began a program to address these challenges by increasing array sensitivity. Development and deployment of broadband VLBI systems (Whitney et al. 2013; Vertatschitsch et al. 2015) led to data recording rates that now exceed those of typical cm-VLBI arrays by more than an order of magnitude. Parallel efforts to support infrastructure upgrades at additional VLBI sites, including the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA; Matthews et al. 2018; Goddi et al. 2019) and the Atacama Pathfinder Experiment telescope (APEX) in Chile (Wagner et al. 2015), the Large Millimeter Telescope Alfonso Serrano (LMT) in Mexico (Ortiz-León et al. 2016), the IRAM 30 m telescope on Pico Veleta (PV) in Spain (Greve et al. 1995), the Submillimeter Telescope Observatory in Arizona (SMT; Baars et al. 1999), the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope (JCMT) and the Submillimeter Array (SMA) in Hawai’i (Doeleman et al. 2008; Primiani et al. 2016; Young et al. 2016), and the South Pole Telescope (SPT) in Antarctica (Kim et al. 2018a), extended the range of EHT baselines and coverage, and the overall collecting area of the array. These developments increased the sensitivity of the EHT by a factor of ∼30 over early experiments that confirmed horizon-scale structures in M87* and Sgr A* (Doeleman et al. 2008, 2012; Akiyama et al. 2015; Johnson et al. 2015; Fish et al. 2016; Lu et al. 2018). For the observations at a wavelength of 1.3 mm presented here, the EHT collaboration fielded a global VLBI array of eight stations over six geographical locations. Baseline lengths ranged from 160 m to 10,700 km toward M87* , resulting in an array with a theoretical diffraction-limit resolution of ∼25 μas (see Figures 1 and 2, and Paper II). 4. Observations, Correlation, and Calibration We observed M87* on 2017 April 5, 6, 10, and 11 with the EHT. Weather was uniformly good to excellent with nightlymedian zenith atmospheric opacities at 230 GHz ranging from 0.03 to 0.28 over the different locations. The observations were scheduled as a series of scans of three to seven minutes in duration, with M87* scans interleaved with those on the quasar 3C 279. The number of scans obtained on M87* per night ranged from 7 (April 10) to 25 (April 6) as a result of different observing schedules. A description of the M87* observations, their correlation, calibration, and validated final data products is presented in Paper III and briefly summarized here. At each station, the astronomical signal in both polarizations and two adjacent 2 GHz wide frequency bands centered at 227.1 and 229.1 GHz were converted to baseband using standard heterodyne techniques, then digitized and recorded at a total rate of 32 Gbps. Correlation of the data was carried out using a software correlator (Deller et al. 2007) at the MIT Haystack Observatory and at the Max-Planck-Institut für Radioastronomie, each handling one of the two frequency bands. Differences between the two independent correlators were shown to be negligible through the exchange of a few identical scans for cross comparison. At correlation, signals were aligned to a common time reference using an a priori Earth geometry and clock model. A subsequent fringe-fitting step identified detections in correlated signal power while phase calibrating the data for residual delays and atmospheric effects. Using ALMA as a highly sensitive reference station enabled critical corrections for ionospheric and tropospheric distortions at the other sites. Fringe fitting was performed with three independent automated pipelines, each tailored to the specific characteristics of the EHT observations, such as the wide bandwidth, susceptibility to atmospheric turbulence, and array heterogeneity (Blackburn et al. 2019; Janssen et al. 2019, Paper III). The pipelines made use of standard software for the processing of radio-interferometric dataand phase. Comparisons between the three independent pipelines, the two polarizations, and the two frequency bands enabled estimation of systematic baseline errors of around 1° in visibility phase and 2% for visibility amplitudes. These small limiting errors remain after fitting station sensitivities and unknown station phases via self-calibration (Pearson & Readhead 1984) and affect interferometric closure quantities (Rogers et al. 1974; Readhead et al. 1980). Following data validation and pipeline comparisons, a single pipeline output was designated as the primary data set of the first EHT science data release and used for subsequent results, while the outputs of the other two pipelines offer supporting validation data sets. The final calibrated complex visibilities V(u, v) correspond to the Fourier components of the brightness distribution on the sky at spatial frequency (u, v) determined by the projected baseline expressed in units of the observing wavelength (van Cittert 1934; Thompson et al. 2017). Figure 2 shows the (u, v) coverage and calibrated visibility amplitudes of M87* for April 11. The visibility amplitudes resemble those of a thin ring (i.e., a Bessel function J0; see Figure 10.12 in Thompson et al. 2017). Such a ring model with diameter 46 μas has a first null at 3.4 Gλ, matching the minimum in observed flux density and is consistent with a reduced flux density on the longest Hawai’i–Spain baseline (JCMT/SMA-PV) near 8 Gλ. This particular ring model, shown with a dashed line in the bottom panel of Figure 2, is only illustrative and does not fit all features in the data. First, visibility amplitudes on the shortest VLBI baselines suggest that about half of the compact flux density seen on the ∼2 km ALMA–APEX baseline is resolved out by the interferometer beam (Paper IV). Second, differences in the depth of the first minimum as a function of orientation, as well as highly nonzero measured closure phases, indicate some degree of asymmetry in the source (Papers III, VI). Finally, the visibility amplitudes represent only half of the information available to us. We will next explore images and more complex geometrical models that can fit the measured visibility amplitudes and phases.5. Images and Features We reconstructed images from the calibrated EHT visibilities, which provide results that are independent of models (Paper IV). However, there are two major challenges in reconstructing images from EHT data. First, EHT baselines sample a limited range of spatial frequencies, corresponding to angular scales between 25 and 160 μas. Because the (u, v) plane is only sparsely sampled (Figure 2), the inverse problem is under-constrained. Second, the measured visibilities lack absolute phase calibration and can have large amplitude calibration uncertainties. To address these challenges, imaging algorithms incorporate additional assumptions and constraints that are designed to produce images that are physically plausible (e.g., positive and compact) or conservative (e.g., smooth), while remaining consistent with the data. We explored two classes of algorithms for reconstructing images from EHT data. The first class of algorithms is the traditional CLEAN approach used in radio interferometry (e.g., Högbom 1974; Clark 1980). CLEAN is an inverse-modeling approach that deconvolves the interferometer point-spread function from the Fourier-transformed visibilities. When applying CLEAN, it is necessary to iteratively self-calibrate the data between rounds of imaging to solve for time-variable phase and amplitude errors in the data. The second class of algorithms is the so-called regularized maximum likelihood (RML; e.g., Narayan & Nityananda 1986; Wiaux et al. 2009; Thiébaut 2013). RML is a forward-modeling approach that searches for an image that is not only consistent with the observed data but also favors specified image properties (e.g., smoothness or compactness). As with CLEAN, RML methods typically iterate between imaging and self-calibration, although they can also be used to image directly on robust closure quantities immune to station-based calibration errors. RML methods have been extensively developed for the EHT (e.g., Honma et al. 2014; Bouman et al. 2016; Akiyama et al. 2017; Chael et al. 2018b; see also Paper IV). Every imaging algorithm has a variety of free parameters that can significantly affect the final image. We adopted a twostage imaging approach to control and evaluate biases in the reconstructions from our choices of these parameters. In the first stage, four teams worked independently to reconstruct the first EHT images of M87* using an early engineering data release. The teams worked without interaction to minimize shared bias, yet each produced an image with a similar prominent feature: a ring of diameter ∼38–44 μas with enhanced brightness to the south (see Figure 4 in Paper IV). In the second imaging stage, we developed three imaging pipelines, each using a different software package and associated methodology. Each pipeline surveyed a range of imaging parameters, producing between ∼103 and 104 images from different parameter combinations. We determined a “TopSet” of parameter combinations that both produced images of M87* that were consistent with the observed data and that reconstructed accurate images from synthetic data sets corresponding to four known geometric models (ring, crescent, filled disk, and asymmetric double source). For all pipelines, the Top-Set images showed an asymmetric ring with a diameter of ∼40 μas, with differences arising primarily in the effective angular resolutions achieved by different methods. For each pipeline, we determined the single combination of fiducial imaging parameters out of the Top-Set that performed best across all the synthetic data sets and for each associated imaging methodology (see Figure 11 in Paper IV). Because the angular resolutions of the reconstructed images vary among the pipelines, we blurred each image with a circular Gaussian to a common, conservative angular resolution of 20 μas. The top part of Figure 3 shows an image of M87* on April 11 obtained by averaging the three pipelines’ blurred fiducial images. The image is dominated by a ring with an asymmetric azimuthal profile that is oriented at a position angle ∼170° east of north. Although the measured position angle increases by ∼20° between the first two days and the last two days, the image features are broadly consistent across the different imaging methods and across all four observing days. This is shown in the bottom part of Figure 3, which reports the images on different days (see also Figure 15 in Paper IV). These results are also consistent with those obtained from visibility-domain fitting of geometric and general-relativistic magnetohydrodynamics (GRMHD) models (Paper VI). 6. Theoretical Modeling The appearance of M87* has been modeled successfully using GRMHD simulations, which describe a turbulent, hot, magnetized disk orbiting a Kerr black hole. They naturally produce a powerful jet and can explain the broadband spectral energy distribution observed in LLAGNs. At a wavelength of 1.3 mm, and as observed here, the simulations also predict a shadow and an asymmetric emission ring. The latter does not necessarily coincide with the innermost stable circular orbit, or ISCO, and is instead related to the lensed photon ring. To explore this scenario in great detail, we have built a library of synthetic images (Image Library) describing magnetized accretion flows onto black holes in GR145 (Paper V). The images themselves are produced from a library of simulations (Simulation Library) collecting the results of four codes solving the equations of GRMHD (Gammie et al. 2003; Sadowski et al. ̧ 2014; Porth et al. 2017; Liska et al. 2018). The elements of the Simulation Library have been coupled to three different general-relativistic ray-tracing and radiative-transfer codes (GRRT, Bronzwaer et al. 2018; Mościbrodzka & Gammie 2018; Z. Younsi et al. 2019, in preparation). We limit ourselves to providing here a brief description of the initial setups and the physical scenarios explored in the simulations; see Paper V for details on both the GRMHD and GRRT codes, which have been cross-validated A typical GRMHD simulation in the library is characterized by two parameters: the dimensionless spin a Jc GM2 * º , where J and M are, respectively, the spin angular momentum and mass of the black hole, and the net dimensionless magnetic flux over the event horizon MRg 2 1 2 f º F ( ˙ ) , where Φ and M˙ are the magnetic flux and mass flux (or accretion rate) across the horizon, respectively. Since the GRMHD simulations scale with the black hole mass, M is set only at the time of producing the synthetic images with the GRRT codes. The magnetic flux is generally nonzero because magnetic field is trapped in the black hole by the accretion flow and sustained by currents in the surrounding plasma. These two parameters allow us to describe accretion disks that are either prograde (a*  0) or retrograde (a* < 0) with respect to the black hole spin axis, and whose accretion flows are either “SANE” (from “Standard and Normal Evolution,” Narayan et al. 2012) with f ∼ 1, or “MAD” (from “Magnetically Arrested Disk,” Narayan et al. 2003) with f ∼ 15.146 In essence, SANE accretion flows are characterized by moderate dimensionless magnetic flux and result from initial magnetic fields that are smaller than those in MAD flows. Furthermore, the opening angles of the magnetic funnel in SANE flows are generically smaller than those in MAD flows. Varying a* and f, we have performed 43 high-resolution, three-dimensional and long-term simulations covering well the physical properties of magnetized accretion flows onto Kerr black holes. All GRMHD simulations were initialized with a weakly magnetized torus orbiting around the black hole and driven into a turbulent state by instabilities, including the magnetorotational instability (Balbus & Hawley 1991), rapidly reaching a quasistationary state. Once a simulation was completed, the relevant flow properties at different times are collected to be employed for the further post-processing of the GRRT codes. The generation of synthetic images requires, besides the properties of the fluid (magnetic field, velocity field, and rest-mass density), also the emission and absorption coefficients, the inclination i (the angle between the accretion-flow angular-momentum vector and the line of sight), the position angle PA (the angle east of north, i.e., counter-clockwise on our images, of the projection on the sky of the accretion-flow angular momentum), the black hole mass M and distance D to the observer. Because the photons at 1.3 mm wavelength observed by the EHT are believed to be produced by synchrotron emission, whose absorption and emission coefficients depend on the electron distribution function, we consider the plasma to be composed of electrons and ions that have the same temperature in the magnetically dominated regions of the flow (funnel), but have a substantially different temperature in the gas dominated regions (disk midplane). In particular, we consider the plasma to be composed of nonrelativistic ions with temperature Ti and relativistic electrons with temperature Te. A simple prescription for the ratio of the temperatures of the two species can then be imposed in terms of a single parameter (Mościbrodzka et al. 2016), such that the bulk of the emission comes either from weakly magnetized (small Rhigh, Te ; Ti/Rhigh) or strongly magnetized (large Rhigh, Te ; Ti) regions. In SANE models, the disk (jet) is weakly (strongly) magnetized, so that low (high) Rhigh models produce most of the emission in the disk (jet). In MAD models, there are strongly magnetized regions everywhere and the emission is mostly from the disk midplane. While this prescription is not the only one possible, it has the advantage of being simple, sufficiently generic, and robust (see Paper V for a discussion of nonthermal particles and radiative cooling). Since each GRMHD simulation can be used to describe several different physical scenarios by changing the prescribed electron distribution function, we have used the Simulation Library to generate more than 420 different physical scenarios. Each scenario is then used to generate hundreds of snapshots at different times in the simulation leading to more than 62,000 objects in the Image Library. From the images we have created model visibilities that correspond to the EHT observing schedule and compared them to the measured VLBI visibilities as detailed in Paper VI. As an example, the top row of Figure 4 shows three GRMHD model snapshots from the Image Library with different spins and flow type, which fitted closure phases and amplitudes of the April 11 data best. For these models we produced simulated visibilities for the April 11 schedule and weather parameters and calibrated them with a synthetic data generation and calibration pipeline (Blecher et al. 2017; Janssen et al. 2019; Roelofs et al. 2019a). The simulated data were then imaged with the same pipeline used for the observed images. The similarities between the simulated images (bottom row of Figure 4) and the observed images (Figure 3) are remarkable. Overall, when combining all the information contained in both the Simulation Library and Image Library, the physical origin of the emission features of the image observed in M87* can be summarized as follows. First, the observed image is consistent with the hypothesis that it is produced by a magnetized accretion flow orbiting within a few rg of the event horizon of a Kerr black hole. The asymmetric ring is produced by a combination of strong gravitational lensing and relativistic beaming, while the central flux depression is the observational signature of the black hole shadow. Interestingly, all of the accretion models are consistent with the EHT image, except for the a* = −0.94 MAD models, which fail to produce images that are sufficiently stable (i.e., the variance among snapshots is too large to be statistically consistent with the observed image). Second, the north–south asymmetry in the emission ring is controlled by the black hole spin and can be used to deduce its orientation. In corotating disk models (where the angular momentum of the matter and of the black hole are aligned), the funnel wall, or jet sheath, rotates with the disk and the black hole; in counterrotating disk models, instead, the luminous funnel wall rotates with the black hole but against the disk. The north–south asymmetry is consistent with models in which the black hole spin is pointing away from Earth and inconsistent with models in which the spin points toward Earth. Third, adopting an inclination of 17° between the approaching jet and the line of sight (Walker et al. 2018), the west orientation of the jet, and a corotating disk model, matter in the bottom part of the image is moving toward the observer (clockwise rotation as seen from Earth). This is consistent with the rotation of the ionized gas on scales of 20 pc, i.e., 7000 rg (Ford et al. 1994; Walsh et al. 2013) and with the inferred sense of rotation from VLBI observations at 7 mm (Walker et al. 2018). Finally, models with a* = 0 are disfavored by the very conservative observational requirement that the jet power be Pjet > 1042 erg s−1 . Furthermore, in those models that produce a sufficiently powerful jet, it is powered by extraction of black holespin energy through mechanisms akin to the Blandford–Znajek process. 7. Model Comparison and Parameter Estimation In Paper VI, the black hole mass is derived from fitting to the visibility data of geometric and GRMHD models, as well as from measurements of the ring diameter in the image domain. Our measurements remain consistent across methodologies, algorithms, data representations, and observed data sets. Motivated by the asymmetric emission ring structures seen in the reconstructed images (Section 5) and the similar emission structures seen in the images from GRMHD simulations (Section 6), we developed a family of geometric crescent models (see, e.g., Kamruddin & Dexter 2013) to compare directly to the visibility data. We used two distinct Bayesian-inference algorithms and demonstrate that such crescent models are statistically preferred over other comparably complex geometric models that we have explored. We find that the crescent models provide fits to the data that are statistically comparable to those of the reconstructed images presented in Section 5, allowing us to determine the basic parameters of the crescents. The best-fit models for the asymmetric emission ring have diameters of 43 ± 0.9 μas and fractional widths relative to the diameter of <0.5. The emission drops sharply interior to the asymmetric emission ring with the central depression having a brightness <10% of the average brightness in the ring. The diameters of the geometric crescent models measure the characteristic sizes of the emitting regions that surround the shadows and not the sizes of the shadows themselves (see, e.g., Psaltis et al. 2015; Johannsen et al. 2016; Kuramochi et al. 2018, for potential biases). We model the crescent angular diameter d in terms of the gravitational radius and distance, qg º GM c2D, as d = αθg, where α is a function of spin, inclination, and Rhigh (α ; 9.6–10.4 corresponds to emission from the lensed photon ring only). We calibrate α by fitting the geometric crescent models to a large number of visibility data generated from the Image Library. We can also fit the model visibilities generated from the Image Library to the M87* data, which allows us to measure θg directly. However, such a procedure is complicated by the stochastic nature of the emission in the accretion flow (see, e.g., Kim et al. 2016). To account for this turbulent structure, we developed a formalism and multiple algorithms that estimate the statistics of the stochastic components using ensembles of images from individual GRMHD simulations. We find that the visibility data are not inconsistent with being a realization of many of the GRMHD simulations. We conclude that the recovered model parameters are consistent across algorithms. Finally, we extract ring diameter, width, and shape directly from reconstructed images (see Section 5). The results are consistent with the parameter estimates from geometric crescent models. Following the same GRMHD calibrationprocedure, we infer values of θg and α for regularized maximum likelihood and CLEAN reconstructed images. Combining results from all methods, we measure emission region diameters of 42 ± 3 μas, angular sizes of the gravitational radius θg = 3.8 ± 0.4 μas, and scaling factors in the range α = 10.7–11.5, with associated errors of ∼10%. For the distance of 16.8 ± 0.8 Mpc adopted here, the black hole mass is M = (6.5 ± 0.7) × 109 Me; the systematic error refers to the 68% confidence level and is much larger than the statistical error of 0.2 × 109 Me. Moreover, by tracing the peak of the emission in the ring we can determine the shape of the image and obtain a ratio between major and minor axis of the ring that is 4:3; this corresponds to a 10% deviation from circularity in terms of root-mean-square distance from an average radius. Table 1 summarizes the measured parameters of the image features and the inferred black hole properties based on data from all bands and all days combined. The inferred black hole mass strongly favors the measurement based on stellar dynamics (Gebhardt et al. 2011). The size, asymmetry, brightness contrast, and circularity of the reconstructed images and geometric models, as well as the success of the GRMHD simulations in describing the interferometric data, are consistent with the EHT images of M87* being associated with strongly lensed emission from the vicinity of a Kerr black hole. 8. Discussion A number of elements reinforce the robustness of our image and the conclusion that it is consistent with the shadow of a black hole as predicted by GR. First, our analysis has used multiple independent calibration and imaging techniques, as well as four independent data sets taken on four different days in two separate frequency bands. Second, the image structure matches previous predictions well (Dexter et al. 2012; Mościbrodzka et al. 2016) and is well reproduced by our extensive modeling effort presented in Section 6. Third, because our measurement of the black hole mass in M87* is not inconsistent with all of the prior mass measurements, this allows us to conclude that the null hypothesis of the Kerr metric (Psaltis et al. 2015; Johannsen et al. 2016), namely, the assumption that the black hole is described by the Kerr metric, has not been violated. Fourth, the observed emission ring reconstructed in our images is close to circular with an axial ratio 4:3; similarly, the time average images from our GRMHD simulations also show a circular shape. After associating to the shape of the shadow a deviation from the circularity—measured in terms of root-mean-square distance from an average radius in the image—that is 10%, we can set an initial limit of order four on relative deviations of the quadrupole moment from the Kerr value (Johannsen & Psaltis 2010). Stated differently, if Q is the quadrupole moment of a Kerr black hole and ΔQ the deviation as deduced from circularity, our measurement—and the fact that the inclination angle is assumed to be small—implies that ΔQ/Q  4 (ΔQ/Q = ε in Johannsen & Psaltis 2010). Finally, when comparing the visibility amplitudes of M87* with 2009 and 2012 data (Doeleman et al. 2012; Akiyama et al. 2015), the overall radio core size at a wavelength of 1.3 mm has not changed appreciably, despite variability in total flux density. This stability is consistent with the expectation that the size of the shadow is a feature tied to the mass of the black hole and not to properties of a variable plasma flow. It is also straightforward to reject some alternative astrophysical interpretations. For instance, the image is unlikely to be produced by a jet-feature as multi-epoch VLBI observations of the plasma jet in M87 (Walker et al. 2018) on scales outside the horizon do not show circular rings. The same is typically true for AGN jets in large VLBI surveys (Lister et al. 2018). Similarly, were the apparent ring a random alignment of emission blobs, they should also have moved away at relativistic speeds, i.e., at ∼5 μas day−1 (Kim et al. 2018b), leading to measurable structural changes and sizes. GRMHD models of hollow jet cones could show under extreme conditions stable ring features (Pu et al. 2017), but this effect is included to a certain extent in our Simulation Library for models with Rhigh > 10. Finally, an Einstein ring formed by gravitational lensing of a bright region in the counter-jet would require a fine-tuned alignment and a size larger than that measured in 2012 and 2009. At the same time, it is more difficult to rule out alternatives to black holes in GR, because a shadow can be produced by any compact object with a spacetime characterized by unstable circular photon orbits (Mizuno et al. 2018). Indeed, while the Kerr metric remains a solution in some alternative theories of gravity (Barausse & Sotiriou 2008; Psaltis et al. 2008), nonKerr black hole solutions do exist in a variety of such modified theories (Berti et al. 2015). Furthermore, exotic alternatives to black holes, such as naked singularities (Shaikh et al. 2019), boson stars (Kaup 1968; Liebling & Palenzuela 2012), and gravastars (Mazur & Mottola 2004; Chirenti & Rezzolla 2007), are admissible solutions within GR and provide concrete, albeit contrived, models. Some of such exotic compact objects can already be shown to be incompatible with our observations given our maximum mass prior. For example, the shadows of naked singularities associated with Kerr spacetimes with a 1 * ∣ ∣ > are substantially smaller and very asymmetric compared to those of Kerr black holes (Bambi & Freese 2009). Also, some commonly used types of wormholes (Bambi 2013) predict much smaller shadows than we have measured.However, other compact-object candidates need to be analyzed with more care. Boson stars are an example of compact objects having circular photon orbits but without a surface or an event horizon. In such a spacetime, null geodesics are redirected outwards toward distant observers (Cunha et al. 2016), so that the shadow can in principle be filled with emission from lensed images of distant radio sources generating a complex mirror image of the sky. More importantly, accretion flows onto boson stars behave differently as they do not produce jets but stalled accretion tori that make them distinguishable from black holes (Olivares et al. 2019). Gravastars provide examples of compact objects having unstable photon orbits and a hard surface, but not an event horizon. In this case, while a single image of the accretion flow could in principle be very similar to that coming from a black hole, differences of the flow dynamics at the stellar surface (H. Olivares et al. 2019, in preparation), strong magnetic fields (Lobanov 2017), or excess radiation in the infrared (Broderick & Narayan 2006) would allow one to distinguish a gravastar from a black hole. Altogether, the results derived here provide a new way to study compact-object spacetimes and are complementary to the detection of gravitational waves from coalescing stellar-mass black holes with LIGO/Virgo (Abbott et al. 2016). Our constraints on deviations from the Kerr geometry rely only on the validity of the equivalence principle and are agnostic about the underlying theory of gravity, but can be used to measure, with ever improved precision, the parameters of the background metric. On the other hand, current gravitational-wave observations of mergers probe the dynamics of the underlying theory, but cannot rely on the possibility of multiple and repeated measurements of the same source. To underline the complementarity of gravitational-wave and electromagnetic observations of black holes, we note that a basic feature of black holes in GR is that their size scales linearly with mass. Combining our constraints on the supermassive black hole in M87 with those on the stellar-mass black holes detected via gravitational waves we can infer that this property holds over eight orders of magnitude. While this invariance is a basic prediction of GR, which is a scale-free theory, it need not be satisfied in other theories that introduce a scale to the gravitational field. Finally, the radio core in M87 is quite typical for powerful radio jets in general. It falls on the fundamental plane of black hole activity for radio cores (Falcke et al. 2004), connecting via simple scaling laws the radio and X-ray properties of lowluminosity black hole candidates across vastly different mass and accretion rate scales. This suggests that they are powered by a scale-invariant common object. Therefore, establishing the black hole nature for M87* also supports the general paradigm that black holes are the power source for active galaxies. 9. Conclusion and Outlook We have assembled the EHT, a global VLBI array operating at a wavelength of 1.3 mm and imaged horizon-scale structures around the supermassive black hole candidate in M87. Using multiple independent calibration, imaging, and analysis methods, we find the image to be dominated by a ring structure of 42 ± 3 μas diameter that is brighter in the south. This structure has a central brightness depression with a contrast of >10:1, which we identify with the black hole shadow. Comparing the data with an extensive library of synthetic images obtained from GRMHD simulations covering different physical scenarios and plasma conditions reveals that the basic features of our image are relatively independent of the detailed astrophysical model. This allows us to derive an estimate for the black hole mass of M = (6.5 ± 0.7) × 109 Me. Based on our modeling and information on the inclination angle, we derive the sense of rotation of the black hole to be in the clockwise direction, i.e., the spin of the black hole points away from us. The brightness excess in the south part of the emission ring is explained as relativistic beaming of material rotating in the clockwise direction as seen by the observer, i.e., the bottom part of the emission region is moving toward the observer. Future observations and further analysis will test the stability, shape, and depth of the shadow more accurately. One of its key features is that it should remain largely constant with time as the mass of M87* is not expected to change measurably on human timescales. Polarimetric analysis of the images, which we will report in the future, will provide information on the accretion rate via Faraday rotation (Bower et al. 2003; Marrone et al. 2007; Kuo et al. 2014; Mościbrodzka et al. 2017) and on the magnetic flux. Higher-resolution images can be achieved by going to a shorter wavelength, i.e., 0.8 mm (345 GHz), by adding more telescopes and, in a more distant future, with space-based interferometry (Kardashev et al. 2014; Fish et al. 2019; Palumbo et al. 2019; F. Roelofs et al. 2019b, in preparation). Another primary EHT source, Sgr A* , has a precisely measured mass three orders of magnitude smaller than that of M87* , with dynamical timescales of minutes instead of days. Observing the shadow of Sgr A* will require accounting for this variability and mitigation of scattering effects caused by the interstellar medium (Johnson 2016; Lu et al. 2016; Bouman et al. 2018). Time dependent nonimaging analysis can be used to potentially track the motion of emitting matter near the black hole, as reported recently through interferometric observations in the near-infrared (Gravity Collaboration et al. 2018b). Such observations provide separate tests and probes of GR on yet another mass scale (Broderick & Loeb 2005; Doeleman et al. 2009b; Roelofs et al. 2017; Medeiros et al. 2017). In conclusion, we have shown that direct studies of the event horizon shadow of supermassive black hole candidates are now possible via electromagnetic waves, thus transforming this elusive boundary from a mathematical concept to a physical entity that can be studied and tested via repeated astronomical observations.	Abstract When surrounded by a transparent emission region, black holes are expected to reveal a dark shadow caused by gravitational light bending and photon capture at the event horizon. To image and study this phenomenon, we have assembled the Event Horizon Telescope, a global very long baseline interferometry array observing at a wavelength of 1.3 mm. This allows us to reconstruct event-horizon-scale images of the supermassive black hole candidate in the center of the giant elliptical galaxy M87. We have resolved the central compact radio source as an asymmetric bright emission ring with a diameter of 42 ± 3 μas, which is circular and encompasses a central depression in brightness with a flux ratio 10:1. The emission ring is recovered using different calibration and imaging schemes, with its diameter and width remaining stable over four different observations carried out in different days. Overall, the observed image is consistent with expectations for the shadow of a Kerr black hole as predicted by general relativity. The asymmetry in brightness in the ring can be explained in terms of relativistic beaming of the emission from a plasma rotating close to the speed of light around a black hole. We compare our images to an extensive library of ray-traced general-relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations of black holes and derive a central mass of M = (6.5 ± 0.7) × 109 Me. Our radiowave observations thus provide powerful evidence for the presence of supermassive black holes in centers of galaxies and as the central engines of active galactic nuclei. They also present a new tool to explore gravity in its most extreme limit and on a mass scale that was so far not accessible. Key words: accretion, accretion disks – black hole physics – galaxies: active – galaxies: individual (M87) – galaxies: jets – gravitation	The Event Horizon Telescope Collaboration
